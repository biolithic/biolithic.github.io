i m gonna keep it simple  mario is a male plumber you play as in a video game called super mario. he saves a female princess called peach. mario has a male brother named luigi  who he himself has a crush on another female princess named daisy. yoshi is a dinosaur who has a big appetite. there  that simple!
you know  back in the 90 s  we kids thought it was gross to even think about who our teachers were married to in relationships with. kids nowadays would also think like that  too  if these freaks teaching them would leave them alone and stop grooming them.
it is getting harder and harder to tell the difference between comedy and reality.
i would not do well in school these days. i remember calling out teachers when they made mistakes on the chalk board. if i heard this crap today i would have a permanent seat in the principal s office. there d be a plaque with my name on it. these teachers would despise me  because i would most certainly call them out on their bullshit. i remember we had some gay teachers  my drama teacher was gay  but he never said a word about it. the problem i have with all of this is that straight  cis  teachers never rubbed their heterosexuality in our faces. we didn t even know teachers went to the grocery store. i remember being surprised  when i was 8 years old  at seeing my teacher in the store... out in public. i had no idea they had lives outside of school. because it wasn t important what they did in their personal lives. i don t need to know who my teacher has sex with  i need to know math  writing and history... among other things. i don t need to know what you have between your legs! jeez!!!
hey kids  i m pansexual!  that means i will have sex with anything!  i m also polyamous  so i can have sex with everybody!  it would be really cool if we could all be pansexual polyamorous non-binary people together.  but don t tell your parents - they wouldn t understand and you d get in trouble!   -every single one of these teachers
pay attention to this teacher  no doubt nintendo s lawyers are going to have a chat with her soon
imagine sending ur kids to school to learn and they come back telling you this...
they re trying to teach kids to stereotype people based on their looks. reminds me of that teacher tiktok where she talks about assigning sexualities to clue characters  like  this one  she looks like a baddie lesbian! .culture is crumbling.
schools are out of control these days. teachers telling kids their way too personal stories  teaching lgbtqiaxyz123 nonsense  bringing books with sexual content  and taking kids to places that have drag queens  or bringing drag queens to them . now we have one getting weird with video game characters.  i should really thank my mom for having me when she did. melonie s laugh always puts a smile on my face.
we have those exact same kind of people in denmark  we call them pedophiles here ...
after one too many videos like this  i ve been shamed into admitting my own perverse nature  i am a white  heterosexual  male  and i m married to a white  heterosexual  female.  yes  that s right  neither of us are gay  or trans  and to top it off  we re white and married!  we re sickos  and i wish we could do better .
what is wrong with these insane people always having to label everything  including fictional characters!
this isn t representation  it s obsession
it is about time someone speaks up. i don t care what someones sexual preference is or what someone identifies as it is not appropriate to bring to students in school. there are many places and organizations that can help someone figure that stuff out if they don t have anyone in their lives they can trust. not everything should be about teaching influencing kids. kids aren t stupid  let them be kidd as long as they can.
hey! teacher! leve them mario characters alone! this is so ridiculous! by the way love your shirt! you look amazing today!
this  teacher  needs to be fired...immediately!!!!
the worst part is that if you disprove them with creators intent  they tell you not to take children s characters seriously even though they tie their identities to children s characters.
all these years i thought demisexual meant that you were sexually attracted to demi lovato .
it s crazy how teachers are now when i was in third grade i asked my english teacher about the tattoo on the back of her neck she looked at me with a shock on her face and said  no i m not gonna tell you about my tattoo i m your teacher josh that s inappropriate  i wish teachers were like that again
is there anything people aren t trying to ruin  everyone thinks they can just make their sexual fantasies for characters canon. people need to stop being so obsessed with sex and gender identity. great video melonie  keep dunkin on this goofiness!
luigi and daisy are actually a couple in the mario series and nintendo was going for an opposites attract type thing with them cuz luigi is shy and timid while daisy is more brash and outgoing and daisy even calls luigi  sweetie  in mario power tennis on the gamecube after she wins a tennis tournament in the game.
so what about birdo  a mario character nintendo basically said was gender ambiguous
too much information. reeeeeeeeeeee
well  he s technically not a dinosaur  he s a yoshi  the game theorists made a video about it if you want to watch lol
yoshi is a male dinosaur who...lays...eggs
@david franz  yeah and bowser is a dragon turtle that breathes fire. got a problem with that
@david franz  he s a fictional creature  but even if the yoshi species were real it wouldn t the first animal to have the males to be the one to have the babies  just look at seahorses
@dragon savage  and there s turtles with wings and shoes on who walk around and dance  and little mushroom monsters named goombas lol
@stumpy the tree  you really don t get the reference   i m referencing the solid snake codec with otacon in smash bros.
@david franz  oh i m sorry i guess i didn t
i miss the 90s
speak for yaself.i was 16 in 94 and we had a teacher named miss hawkins  that was in her early 20 s. there wasn t a boy in school who didn t wanna....... you know
@sega nerd 1991  oh yeah definitely
@roger  i had teacher s like that tbh like daaaamnnnn lol
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   yeah  the 90 s was the most kick ass times  it was like the 80 s on steroids. best time of my life.
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   we re hot for teacher
yeah  this is worse than super cringey nintendo fan fiction....because these people actually believe in this fantasy being reality.
@roger   nothing happened   unfortunately or fortunately that s up for debate lol  but i was her favorite student cause i defended her whenever asshole students would give her shit and she bought  me mcdonald s a lot which was cool
how dare you jk
@david franz  yoshi is female. lol
humans don t self reproduce
i m old enough to remember when pauline was his significant other.. and dk was the bad guy
mario male  who saves and eventually gets in a relationship with princess peachluigh male  who saves and eventually gets in a relationship with  princess daisytoad male who is friends with mario and princess peach yes  even with that high-pitched voice  it s still a guy .princess peach straight female who likes marioprincess daisy straight female who likes luigibowser  the villain who kidnaps peachwario and waluigi badboys who are evil twins of mario and luigiyoshi malebirdo femaledonkey kong malethis is what i grew up with. the only characters who are  gender ambiguous  are the  boo  ghosts in the games.
mario better peg me
@adu1991  i agree. yelloflash2 agrees  most of commenters in that video agree. they did this with benny from the lego movie  they did this with velma from scooby doo  and they did it with luke skywalker. they are communicating to us that these characters are canonically gay when they are just objectively not. what the heck is going on  i m scared  i really am.
epic!!
@gloria thomas  1. opinion  nobody really cares about birdo beyond that strawman you are trying to pull. 2. fact  according to the original mario 2 manual  he was a he who thinks he s a girl and thus wears a bow to put emphasis on this aspect of his personality. 3. fact  mario rpg  legend of the seven stars and mario tennis retconned him as a female.
also  there are many yoshi s. what gender are they  it doesn t f       matter! they re cute dinosaurs  leave sex out of it!!!they just want to ignore the fact that child friendly means non sexual.
@david franz  that s why goku thought piccolo was a yoshi.
@david franz  yeah  yoshi s lay eggs by eating their enemies  souls  and poopin  em out as eggs! what of it
@the lostone  again  reference the snake and otacon codec conversation in smash bros.
@david franz  again  what  when d ya refer it the first time  i m just joke responding to your first post lol
you forgot the fact peach and bowser have a son together. canon.
@david franz  maybe the yoshis as a species are hermaphrodites
technically yoshi is a species  there are thousands of yoshis. but yes  he has a big appetite  and sometimes poops power ups
if yoshis eggs are living beings then yoshi is technically asexual.but in a nature sense.
@dragon savage bowser is also a turtle dragon that has a son with no mom of which nintendos only answer to that question is literally and i guess jokingly that bowser is bowser jr s mom.so take that as you will.japan is fun.
@michael guerra and he was a construction worker and dk then was actually current dk s dad
@metalspinda9 so birdo is trans you guys are actually making this worse lol
@joey n. bowser jr is not canon as peach and bowsers son.
@chandller burse  she s canonically female now  however. all the history for the character was accounted for.
@metalspinda9  someone else said she was ambiguous.also its clear nintendo gives no shits unlike people here and the people mentioned in the vid lol.the non human characters are whatever and yoshi is unlikely to be anything substantial considering the weirdness of its nature then theres pinatas to goombas to whatever those round reptile things are in paper mario.nintendo just wanted to make characters the actual gender matters zero to none its the same as how insomniac made weird aliens in ratchet and clank but i doubt they made sure to understand how each and every species reproduces.this isn t mass effect of course with s codex on each creatures biology.
that s what i thought was going on!
life is never just that simple nintendo already declared a long time ago that this character was trans. i swear to god that you people sound like you only ever read daily wire articles. agree with every single one of them.
@joey n.  that s not canon lol. sunshine itself  the game where that idea even comes  debunks it in the end. currently  the only thing we have to go off for jr s mom is...miyamoto apparently lol  which was obviously him joking  ...i think... .
@wingedlight8415  aaaaaaagh
i believe yoshi is and always was female. she lays eggs
very simple
@david franz  the eggs are his enemies he eats poops them out
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   hhmmm
in the 1970s  the gay declaration is my bedroom is none of  your business  i disobey you.in the 2020s  the declaration is my rainbow bedroom is your business  obey me.
when i was a kid  it was weird to see your teacher at the grocery store. we only ever thought of them as our teachers  not as regular adults like our parents.
@commander vile  facts and  if they tried this crap during the 90s they wouldn t survive they are so lucky they trying to get away with this s   . this so-called teacher is trying to stop kids from seeing this mario bros movie that s coming out this year you might as well block her and if any of her people come in the comment section flag them down blocked cuz this is just ridiculous leave yoshi alone
you mean elementary school kids what teenager thinks a teacher having a spouse is gross
@roger i had a teacher named miss hawkins she was a lot older.i doubt it was the same one but
@christopher loyd i can t say i want to see chris prat as mario either part of me feels or even thinks the movie should be bad but it likely won t fail.its just it shouldn t exist nintendo once made a declaration to never make their properties into movies but money came from sonic movie so now they were like  maybe we can do another they also have other properties that would fit a movie better anyways but eh.
@chandller burse  fact this teacher should not be teaching ninth-graders this stuff. i was not taught that in 9th grade geography global history mathematics science and gym the lunchroom was a hangout spot.if it was it was private in the nurse s room all high schools and middle schools have them that s what that kind of stuff should be said. chris pratt he should get his in his car and drive to ellen page cuz i m not saying elliot i don t want to hear it and apologize to her cuz it s the right thing to do cuz that could affect the movie now you understand that
@christopher loyd  my school never taught geography and yet people blame me for not knowing where every state is without a map.and then we learned the american revolution 5 times in every school i was in never differing to another topic.school is fun
@christopher loyd  what does elliot page have to do with this chris should get in his car and not voice mario but thats a bit mean he s doing his best i guess.but it still as far i can see sucks at least sonic had a voice that sounds like sonic.
i m a 90s kid myself  and to this day   in my 30s   i still don t know 99 percent of my teachers  first names . i remember their last names just fine because that s what you do   but that s about all that i cared to learn about them ....
@hunter bidens plug  didn t keep you up old high school yearbook i kept mine middle school damn i lost when i was cleaning. like i said the only time the one that was talking about that was when you went to the nurse s room
@hunter bidens plug  what a disappointment.my woodworking teacher told us grand stories of his crazy childhood it was sad and fun.same for my earth science one.as if public schooling is useful anyways we learn the same american wars over and over again.
@christopher loyd  still can t form coherent sentences eh never change.
@christopher loyd  incoherent sentence sandwich.
@christopher loyd  i can make sense sort of but it doesn t deny the fact your comments are extremely awkward to read
this is one reason why i dive into fantasy of gaming. to make sure i retain my sanity from this insane world. too bad it is interfering in my gaming. now i wish i could be granted a whole lot of power  in order to exile these people to an island  where there is no escape. they can make their own crappy civilization on that island  and no one will bother them.well  a person can dream.
oh  that s easy. comedy is still obliged to make a modicum of sense.
reality was always already a comedy
that s easy. if it s ridiculous  it s comedy. if it s ridiculous beyond belief  it s real.
i feel you  i ve been saying for the longest how so many of these talking points popping up online sounds like something pulled right outta the onion.
@cain abel  i had the opposite idea. get an island for myself and other people i m cool with. there s no island big enough to hold all the crazies of the world so this is more efficient. xd
i don t mean to  but that was a funny comment.  but i feel you and agree  it s hard to believe that some of these people believe their own thoughts!
i did that in college. my professors couldn t take correction  and would call me aside telling me never to do that again.

i would ve said no. i ll do what i want. i m paying you.
when my parents were in school if you called ojt the teacher for a mistake theyd probably get the wood backed chalkboard erasers thrown ar them or a cane across the back of the hand.
@martian lives matter  yep  and back then teachers had degrees in what they taught  instead of in genders studies.
people need to run background checks on potential  teachers   before they let  more  pedophiles into their classroom
please don t call them teachers they are an insult to the proffession.
@skat26  you can always play with their rules and claim the teacher tried to push her to another  gender  while she was another made up and more obsucere and abstract.you d be out fast.
its sad becuse i am pansexual and the real deal  and these idiots are getting it all whrong  the more we allow them to get by with this the more peaple like me get ridiculed and ignored  becuse they are the bullies not the victems  they saw an operunity and seazed it these peaple are criminals and do not deserve sympathy  if a gay man is nice to you respects your choices please dont be suprised hes just the rare gym that used to represent what freedome of prefrense is not these weardos who act like chimpanzees who want to throw poop at us all.
facts
nintendo presents   mario   rabbids  drag queen edition
i wonder what will be her explanation when those people coming to classroom and they say say read that paper see you in court
yeah  nintendo s lawyers are notoriously rabid. i bet her twitter account will be deleted here soon.
oh the ninjas are coming
it s like that episode of  boy meets world  where alan presses cory about wanting to know what he learned in school today  and cory replies... i decided to be a girl. and alan turns away... mortified.was it predictive programming  probably.
that is why so many kids can t spell  read  write  or do simple math yet still somehow manage to graduate.
imagine people is more concerned of mario s integrity than the kids wellbeing.most people in thebut in yellow comments not here wants to abuse the copyright law because mario is being used for gey agneda. they didn t even think that the lawsuit will not stop her from indoctrinating kids and just latch on other forms of media. parents filing a complaint against the school and the teacher is gonna damage her career more than nintendo damages her pockets.
i d be making an unannounced visit to that school.
@brian d fight for your boi
culture has been crumbling for a century now its just finally entered a death spiral.
@liam warner  true.a number of problems today can be traced back to movements from the past 100 years that may have been well-meaning by some at the time but have had disastrous effects.
guess the baddie lesbian is so bad she murdered someone.
how often do you touch grass  asking for an ally.
@thatharvguy  well  we have front  and back  yards!  so  quite often  i m ashamed to say!
you can declare yourself a marginalized person now.
oh my lord  you are the worst! lol
but in all seriousness  good on you. i wish you and your wife a happy marriage
@kelsie fukuhara  thanks!  we ve had 32 happy years together already.
because they were told their entire lives that they were special. now that they re older they re gutted to discover that they re nbd.  they do it to feel special.
and the same people gets pissed off when you misslabel them. hipocrisity at it s finest.
this entire my gender is my identity thing is all a big trend. the fact that they all look alike proves it. these younger people just don t realize it s a trend because they haven t been alive long enough to have been through a bunch of them. they think this is just how it is.
a dangerous one
thank you so much  andrew!
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
@melonie mac go boom  you should talk to your friends from the simp cast. i guarantee you  you ll find they see nothing wrong witt it.
@melonie mac go boom  just so you know  nintendo did not actually do this to children  and they never will.
roflmao . .. seriously thought it was attracted to intelligence but since the liberals glommed into it i m having my doubts.
you mean it s not someone attracted to the  demi  spell from final fantasy that was replaced with the  gravity  spell that reduces your hit points by 1 4
back in my day  it meant demi moore.
unfortunately this isn t something we can just laugh away. this is something we must take action against and protest. for the sake of our children.
i hate what happened to kara lynne. i ve been praying for her. i hope things turn around for her soon. i ll have to check out her twitch. take care melonie
toad is actually genderless according to miyamato. birdo is female  but because of a mistranslation in the us manual  people have been calling her trans for years. so i wonder which this teacher called her.
man ive never seen people so obsessed with who other people have sex with  let alone made up gaming characters  its like who the f cares  as long as it doesnt directly affect you then if bob and bill or jane and blaire are a couple then just be happy for em or leave em alone..... and anyone who teaches this shit to our kids needs to not be a teacher do that shit on your own time
the fact that these  teachers  and others who are involved with kids daily  want to take characters from games movies etc and sexualize them or address issues of their  sexuality  in any way  really  really exposes the true nature of this putrid movement..
when people s fanfic headcanon isn t official they go to these extremes to try and make it so.
glad there are people like you calling this bs out
being a kid was complicated enough as it is  now they re being held hostage having to remember all these made up labels..i didn t even know my teachers  first name..
it s hard to tell whether these are actual fan theories that this person has  or whether these are weird kinks for her wattpad mario fanfiction.
not woke. i m awake  like the rest of us in the common sense idgaf  community that supports your work melonie. by the way  i identify as trans-parent and my pronouns are who where
i read this on twitter. it s so ridiculous. hey melomie. you look good. cool shirt
there has to be a point where we say enough is enough   literally start pushing back  because at this rate there won t be anything left.
i feel bad for the teacher shortage but i also completely get it. schools are getting worse by the day and anyone who can will be homeschooling their children soon. imagine getting beat up and taught this nonsense and having to do homework on top of that.
i went to public school until jr high  and i don t even know how it works there anymore.  this whole thing disgusts me.hope things turn around for kara lynne. she didn t deserve what happened.
if there was ever a time i wanted nintendo to sue for ip policy protection this is it.
i hope nintendo sues this teacher for defamation of character.
these people are such locusts. flying around everywhere there is a lot of people and attention  then devour everything they can and claim it as their own.
i feel bad for these children.. my child s teacher wrote him a post card letting him know how thankful she is for his kindness and generosity in the classroom  and that he s a shining light.. why can t more teachers be like this
i remember in 1993  i was 8 years old   my guy friend used to wear dresses on non-school uniform day. he had a normal family life and everyone was accepting of it lol. he was just a normal  albeit  slightly camp kid. we re now in our 30 s unsurprisingly it turns out he s gay lol but i dread to think how he would have been groomed etc if he were going to school these days into changing his gender etc.
the only perversion is involving kids  people can identify and be whatever the hell they want. just keep it away from kids. it s simple.
thank you   stephen!  3
thank you melanie for bringing this sickness to the forefront and helping to protect our children..
that is why i generally dislike social media. for the last decade  it seems to have declined into a modern-day witch hunt. and i mean that in the historical definition. it wasn t about rooting out someone bad  but the social pressures and jealousy. someone has land or property you wanted  create an issue and remove them.
her tweets read as though she was defining her person by what she did and not who she is.
@melonie mac go boom  welcome  3
toad and toadette suggests some kind of male and female version.
@adam  that s the way i feel about it  so miyamoto s response about it was just as weird to me as him confirming mario bros 3 wasn t canon...
@shark miyamotos stance on toads is weird enough considering how he prefers to copy paste them in every paper mario rather than make new characters.
@chandller burse  i don t think miyamoto was ever that concerned about the gender and or sexuality of characters in the mario series. he was too concerned with creating an experience he thought would would be enjoyable. truth be i think the fans obsess more over these things than he ever has  because they aren t really relevant.
@tkdboy1889  thats my point
is this her headcanon  or fetishes though  and yes  some do fetishize or obsess on shipping  sexual orientation  and such.
dude  i sincerely remember when i was a kid knowing mario was a man and peach was a woman and not thinking once about them being a  mom and dad  couple and just wanting to find all the keys and connect all the paths on star road and getting 95 completion on my game save.pretty sure i never considered if yoshi was male or female either  i just always preferred the blue yoshi.
how s someone even procure such a unique jersey
why didn t you do that in the first place
nintendo already has too much oppressive power with their lawsuits
@chandller burse  perhaps but the lgbt community deserves it
@bobo boy  well  i taught my children to think for themselves. i mean shit  my daughter came to me with a list of reasons why she thinks santa isn t real. she s a little scary sometimes. she s not a genius or anything  she s just scary aware and logical for a 7 year old. but anyways  i do agree that they shouldn t be teaching it in schools. but since this might take awhile to change  the only thing we can do as parents to ensure our kids don t get brainwashed  is to educate and reinforce logical independence within our children.
this is just....insane!! i can t even find words to describe it! however i definitely agree with the  non nerds  invading fandoms who don t know about the source material and just ship two characters together because in their mind it s  normal  i used to enjoy online role playing but now it s just rediculous and quite disturbing to see all of these weird  couples  appearing almost practically jamming it down everyone s throats and trying to assign sexual identities to them  why does that even matter !
i got sick of everything going on with schools and weird teachers. so i started homeschooling and was happy to see it just focuses on school like a  school  is supposed to. great video
ahhh yes characters made in the early 80s in japan was totally thinking about american gay politics lmao
haven t seen your videos in so many years seeing how you stand in this world made me realize why i always loved your content
mario character s sexuality  this feels like this person looks at way too much rule 34
really nailed it in this video.  laughing is necessary sometimes.  and these aren t gamers.  the gate needs to be shut firmly on them.
the game s  did have a character that s  identity  is in  flux.  the character s name was birdo birdetta catherine  and i think 1 or 2 more names . it is one of those cases where the identity was presumably changed for the western audience s more puritanical censors and then later retconned a few times. although  some do believe and have made arguments that it was just a translation error when sent to translators and later retcons  fixed  the issue. much like how other jrpgs have characters that are referred to both  he  and  she  such as in suikoden 1.
are you going to introduce us to your pets someday melonie  i would like to see them make the occasional guest appearance on your channel.
setting aside that i like your videos in general  your thumbnails are just the best. you re so expressive  you could have been a perfect 1980s sitcom star.
my concern is that my daughter s on the 6th grade and that  happened on the 9th grade  so i dread she having to deal with that later on. maybe that has stopped by then. these teachers should be arrested for that.
tell public schools  so long  gay bowzer
i went to public school and my wife was  mostly  homeschooled. we had to start our oldest in public school early on due to his need for additional speech therapy.but we started homeschooling all 3 kids this year  1st grade  kindergarten  and preschool  after starting the two youngest last spring. it has worked out really  really well and i am glad we decided to do it. my oldest still takes some speech therapy   social skills classes for now at the public school  but at least our school here is good. hopefully he will be able to get out of that soon though.
i m so glad i grew up in a time where the last thing my teachers wanted to discuss with me was their fantasy character spank banks.
this teacher took the snl mario kart skit literally.
you know  i remember when i was in school and you wouldn t necessarily learn the teacher s first name by the end of the year  much less who they were married to or anything else about them. they certainly didn t brag to us about their sex lives  and if they had admitted to being into the kind of degeneracy this piece of crap is pushing on. . .it s students  they would have been publicly fired. i never would have expected that to be so noteworthy.
just another reason the ny dept of education will never see my daughters name on an attendance sheet.
in my 12 years of school  never had a teacher bring up cartoon  comic or video game characters  period.
i followed karalynne and gave her some support    she has a really nice community. thank you for the recommendation  melonie.
ah yes  i remember mario saving the mushroom kingdom and getting a sloppy wet kiss from prince peach.
i actually think demisexual holds traction as being unique. from my understanding its you only get any physical attraction if you connect on a personal level. normal is having both physical and emotional attraction as different aspects. demi only really connects emotionally and it bleeds into physical. we see the same thing in normal relationships. your partner normally stands out originally from a physical point of view then as you get to know them they slowly become more attractive  while being attractive makes you more open to their personality. it doesn t have to do with putting out its more about attraction.
tons of manga anime and games had gender from the era had gender ambiguous characters. for crying out loud james crossdresses a lot in the japanese version of the pokemon anime. even nintendo flat out has said that birdo is gender ambiguous.
@gloria thomas mario and luigi are not likely gay.
@gloria thomas  trying to convince everyone that fictional characters are gay isn t going to improve your life mate  in fact that sounds very depressing to me  getting caught up and emotionally invested in fictional characters sexualities sounds horribly pointless in the grand scheme of things. focus on the important things in life not meaningless  first world fodder
yeah   i just made the same comment.  birdo thinks he s a girl   and would rather be called birdetta.
honestly i believe it was a translation mistake
nintendo has always said that birdo s gender is ambiguous. this does not come at a surprise since gender ambiguous characters are common in japanese games and anime. just look tekken for example...one can assume leo is either male or female as namco had never really been forthcoming about the character gender.
birdo
a lot of languages don t translate well into english and vice versa  because of how flexible the language is and how many words we have that other languages don t have.my first clue was russian  because speaking russian sounds very  broken   the same way russians sound when they speak english... because russians don t have as many words as english does.my next clue was italian  when i was learning italian and got the first got book in italian  i noticed  winterfell  was called  grande inverno   which means  great winter   because winterfell doesn t translate into italian at all.as for japanese  it s my understanding the language has several  cases  so to speak  that acknowledge different levels of social status  so depending on whether you were talking to a commoner or to someone of a higher social status  the inflection would change accordingly.  i don t doubt japanese would be another language that has trouble translating into english.god knows chinese does.
i still never understood homeschooling how do average parents have the time or knowledge to teach kids about subjects like history to chemistry to biology and other crap let alone how parents can also be wrong or biased.schooling is a effy thing in general its why i feel college needs to allow people to choose their own desired subjects.
@chandller burse  lots of curriculums out there. that is what public school teachers often use too  especially for elementary level.as for time  my wife is a stay at home mom and teaches the kids. unlike public school  homeschool usually takes a few hours per day  since public school is mostly babysitting and busy work  with some learning throughout .
this reminds me of when brianna wu claimed that samus aran from metroid was trans!  i have no idea why the sexual orientation or the perceived gender of video game characters is important at all.  definitely shouldn t be brought up to kids.
nintendo should sue her for inappropriately using their characters in class.let this reach nintendo.
i m special  and so is your favorite video game character!  maybe you should be just as special as us!    we ll convert your children... its all grooming
and this is why florida s stance on this shit should be the national standard!
they just want be able to mention their wives and husband s like hetero teachers  yeah i m sure some do but they re in denial about stuff like this.  apparently desantis is  extreme  but there s no extreme the other way of course  how convenient.
we once had a word for grownups talking about your sexuality. hmm  crazy how  grooming  is now apart of our kids daily lives. i grew up in the 90 s and our generation would never know anything about our teachers personal lives. in fact anytime you interacted with teachers outside of school you felt uncomfortable as it was very strange to look at them as normal people. if a teacher told me what i should believe in and forced their views on me  i would probably have been expelled and not ended up as one of the top graduating students in my class of 2004.
i won t be surprised if nintendo decided to sue her 15 33
someone from nintendo should sue her for giving their characters any kind of orientations
when i was at school  we knew what teacher had a preference. they never talked about it to us because it wasn t our business. now  it seems like the teachers really want you to know their sexual preferred embodiment. to kids....
i miss the days when i would ask my teacher  mr ace   what s your first name   and he d answer  mr. that s all you need to know about your teachers. they re making the same mistakes parents made when they tried to be their children s friends. familiarity breeds contempt.
she wanted attention and she s getting it.  that cease and desist from nintendo should be on the way  too.
so the presentation apparently suggests that princess daisy is a lesbian whoever put that presentation together clearly didn t do their research or their homework -  there s no evidence for that claim.also  mario will always be the ultimate video game hero and he will be number one. ain t no one getting anything on him!by the way  great video as always  melonie mac! go boom!
it s like our society took the chris chan pill
most of these teachers need to be in mental wards and not influencing kids.
one reason why schools education systems need to be much more strict on who they hire and who the keep employed like its almost daily its found that a teacher is found out to be like this or similarly bad behavior especially for someone who teaches kids
love the vid melonie! this is so disturbing on so many levels. to take something fun and innocent and corrupt it  to turn it into a tool for a teacher to push a personal agenda. even more concerning and i pray a parent of one of these children files a complaint with the school for the teacher sharing her his own person sex life with students. that is unprofessional on any level. no matter what your chosen life style is. if a male teacher came to school and spoke with his students about how many women he slept with over summer break and possibly gave vague details. he would be fired. it seemed as of last year or the year before they made the qualifications to be a teacher due to the shortage extremely low than before. a bachelor s in education was no longer required and sometime of certification is allowed that only takes months. i do believe it varies by state.   as a christian this is extremely scary. children are not going to grown up knowing the truth. as educators  it is there roll to teach the truth  then if an adult wishes to change their opinion or lifestyle after knowing the facts that is on them. i fear for these kids. they will not know which way is up. as a follower of jesus we are taught to love all but that doesn t mean we condone the life style. i pray the lord protects the minds of these children. also for the women who lost her job due to who she followed. everyone  or a certain majority   wants freedom to do what they want  but do not want that to apply to others that have the ability to show reality and truth.
every true gamer remembers that level in mario 2 when toad went through his  their  transition after digging through all of those sand-filled temples. wild gaming moment for sure.
the birds and the bees use to be an awkward conversation parents eventuality had to have with thier kids.these people are purposefully getting to them early
hey melonie! hope you had a relaxing weekend. you look gorgeous today
it s all i can do is laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of this situation  i ain t really surprised though.
bur canonically  samus has always been a biological female  huh
the classic  we just want to be like everyone else! we just want to be treated equally!  strat.fool me once...
they won t even say how desantis is extreme. i m still waiting for a rational explanation behind it.
@view bot  cnn had 1 indian american guy on who was supportive  but didn t agree with all of it  vs a trans person who didn t look even remotely female and a bunch of karen s supporting the trans panelist. it was so balanced
you do realize that  nintendo games do have gender ambiguous characters right  for cry out loud even princess zelda cross-dressed
@gloria thomas sheik looks like a woman to me.sheik also sounds like a female name.
eh crash bandicoot  sly cooper are better platformers to me.mario may be most popular but the reason i love sunshine and thousand year door is because unlike the rest of the mario series they weren t afraid to change the environments and themes.so sick of the mushroom kingdom its my biggest issue and probably why i realized i was never that big of a mario fan.
@max willson 2000  gee sonichu! a sweetheart of my own would make me so happy!2023  is that your g-spot barb
@iso-didact  no joke! he was a microcosm of where our society was headed. we have a bunch of children adults who are supper sensitive and offended all the time!
chris chan pill mixed with a few too many shots of daniel larson.
how many times are we gonna get tweets from miyomoto telling people to leave his characters alone
when a person wants their head-canon to become canon
a living breathing real life example of a  groomer
moments like these make you think the mccarthy era was perfectly sane.
i m gonna cry... what is wrong with these teachers what are you teaching these kids
what the heck is going on with the world  man  is exactly what i ve been asking myself also
this feels like something babylon bee would come up with.
my goodness these people need help  teaching this to minors is really disgusting and you nailed it when you said that they re trying to use the characters like dolls its so wrong
this is why i support home schooling and school choice.
i wonder when reality will hit  this is insane imo
favorite new youtubers are melonie mac and blair white. love them both for who they are and what they represent.
hope your feeling much better after feeling unwell
we should bring back challenging people to duels again. for times like theses specifically.
what s even funnier is that this happens right around the time their movie is coming out
i literally don t even know what else i could possibly add other than  l   woke   get a life   stay away from children
oh god  how much longer are we gonna be forced to deal with these fiddlers
i was way off playing super mario brothers as a kid   going through hundreds of castles searching to rescue a princess.
one of your best videos. keep them coming. we have to keep calling out this sick  ridiculous stuff.
i wonder if nintendo is going to respond to this
i didn t even know what demisexual meant. i thought it was just another made-up wokie word.edit  you do archery !  i love you even more now!!!
you know how that has to go right you got to tell him that and you got to smack the s    out of them hopefully they don t go to sleep from the power to smack that you give them then the duel is over you won by default finished
it s like they want to ruin the movie before it even f     comes out that s not happening that s not possible. other people just going to ignore it and go see the movie and the more funny thing is the kids are going to see this movie this year and to tell those teachers it was great and watch them stutter
@christopher loyd  just pray that peach didn t get reeeee-educated to be the movie s rey skywalker
@sir ubisan  no it s not  don t believe certain youtubers i m not mentioning no names so imma just leave it at that. it s this teacher that s the goddamn problem why would you tell kids your poly and all that other b      on the real they tell their parents that she s in trouble
@christopher loyd  same thing we all thought he man wasn t going to be when kevin smith reassured it wasn t going to be what clownfish tv called it
bi and poly  what ! wasn t princess daisy just a tomboy who was into luigi kinda to be this cutesy twist on mario and peach. not to be confused with that betamale and girl boss thing.
why are they doing this! ! ! ! ! ! my damn childhood is being killed because of these digenerates
i m eternally grateful that i was born in 1995 and was out of the school system by 2012-13  as they were already discussing things like common core by that point.i agree with melonie wholeheartedly here. i can t be much older or younger than her  and yet i firmly believe that having your kids sent through the public school system is abusive on the level of sending your kids to a cult for 40 hours a week.also  these monsters are actively trying to attack anything even relatively innocent and pervert it to the tune of their depraved imagination for their own gain...
thank you for exposing the evil psychos doing this kind of bullsh t
it is things like this that make me incredibly glad my parents home-schooled me  these  woke activists  need to leave our childhood alone
there should be a sign  up front  for everyone that looks at the front of the school saying   welcome to clown world.  that sign would clearly make a true statement about that school  for everyone with critical thinking skills.
at this point i can only laugh at them.
if you re confused  imagine how messed up the wiring in their heads must be.
i hate that the world is like this now. it s so weird   predatory
that teacher needs to be sued running mario into the ground like this wtf we have officially failed as a human race
this isn t happening just with mario it s happening with other fictional characters from kids franchises like avatar the last air bender where people insist that sokka is a gay and has a thing for zuko and they also insist that danny from danny phantom is trans and it s disbursing to know franchises i grew up with and other popular franchises now have weirdos in the fandoms who only care about their weird ships and put their own sexuality and made up genders on into fictional characters and then use say characters to teach kids about sexuality and gender instead of teaching them how to read and write
in a sane world  this story would read  teacher fired and institutionalized.
ilysm melonie uwu
i m slightly suspicious....why are these teachers going on about this  are they working for us to pull our kids and if so why  literally the only change after hearing from all these nuts is more and more home school kids.
i don t have to guess what more than half the parents are going to tell this teacher.when your filter is all about one thing  that s all you see.
there really needs to be a psych test for teachers as there is one law enforcement.
if this was true  geeks and gamers can never race the same way lol
how is this person a teacher  this teacher got vibes that need to be placed on a registered watch list. would be great if nintendo sued her him them with a defamation case  if that s even possible
the wild thing is berdi the pink yoshi thing with a horn nose is confirmed to be a crossdresser in a japanese only game that shows him being arrested for going into a female bathroom. fun fact of the day
and this is why the florida bill aka parental rights in children s education was in place.
sometimes i think luigi is suppose to be some kind of stereotype of weak men.but then i remember he beat ghosts when his  hero  brother kept getting trapped in freaking paintings three times.
you can watch scooby doo. just don t believe their lies. velma was always straight  they just ruined her in that one scooby doo movie that no one gives two dogcraps about.
@sackboy biggest fan  i mean true. but we need to make a conceded effort to defend the things we care about
@brodie nevis  you are right. but how can we do that  there is nothing we can do. these groomers are not getting arrested.
we shouldn t just be reactionary. we need to be proactive
@sackboy biggest fan no one cares about scooby fans and a lot of others love the movies.unless you don t mean scooby doo the movie where velma was played by a lesbian actress.
or irritate them if they want to flaunt their idiocy.which..... omg!  she s a man man!!!
make me wana die to be honest
hey at least it isn t ancient sparta .they did some weird stuff to boys then.
_   3
oh don t worry they re going to and watch she try to play the victim to try to save her own ass. cuz that s what they always do backpedal she said just take the l when this comes up in court
why  just why  not everything needs to be sexual. stop sexualizing children and children s entertainment
the old saying holds true-misery loves company.
thank you for your broadcast beautiful
no no that teacher disrespecting my girl peach. at least rosalina was spared... for now.
everything i ve heard about what s going on in us schools makes me think raising children in this country is the wrong move.
this alphabet soup identity stuff probably was intended by the japanese developers back in the 90s
well they are  smash bros  so maybe lol jk
princess daisy is a fictional character in the mario series of video games. she debuted in 1989 s super mario land as the ruler of sarasaland. described as a tomboy  she used to be rumored to be luigi s love interest  similarly to princess peach being the love interest of mario  but it is now official after being confirmed by nintendo. this became the plot of the 1993 live-action film super mario bros.  in which luigi saves daisy from king koopa.
people who ship characters are quite crazy. in the genshin community  one group  ei-yae shippers  attacked another group  yae-ayato shippers  because it was a straight ship  as you can see they act like children
the worst thing 2020 has brought up is the fact that these crazy people have become more crazy than ever and now we all have to deal with this unnesesary shit.
i d like to hear your sources on how polyamorous couples  usually  behave. i only know one couple personally but they behave in a manner quite opposite to your broad brush assertion. you might be right but i d like to see a source
demisexual  is just not being a ho  y know the old norm
dat title
i bought my little niece a pink yoshi and told her it was a girl and she loved it.  but privately i had my doubts.  can i just assume the yoshi s gender   i mean  every single yoshi produces eggs!!  how am i supposed to interpret that
i always thought that luigi identified as a jobber since he ll flee more often than not
how they want to corrupt kids is disgusting they should be put in jail
daisy is  if anything  luigi-amorous... the only other character to have even been hinted at caring for her was mario in mario land for the game boy. mario  questionable canonicity aside  has only ever been with two women  peach and pauline. ohp  nope  three... i forgot mizz mouze. although  really  i could make an argument that all of the mario universe is non-canon... and even then  i wouldn t even try to guess at their sexualities. in large part because the two closest things to even get close to sexual in game are how you interpret  peach s cake  and bowser kidnapping and locking up peach... that s it.
13 08-13 21 lmao that was hilarious
what happened to the world in the last 10 years
the only reason they can make these wild assertions about the characters unchallenged is because nintendo saying  no  this is not representative of us or our characters  would only open them up to discrimination lawsuits and bad press. the school is also tyrannized into complying becuse simply saying  this is weird and seems a leeeetle inappropriate to discuss sexual orientations with children  would attract negative attention from the press and possibly government. it s a very low effort and predatory way of recruiting characters into the  community  and indoctrinating children because it relies on everyone s silent complicity. which is fitting.
people stopped parenting their kids.
obama  trudeau  ardern  macron  sturgeon.
i recently put pronouns in my twitter bio  as rarely as i use it . haven t been called out for it yet  though maybe that s because i don t use twitter much... maybe no englishmen saw it yet.
2 53 hey i was homeschooled too! definitely homeschooling my future kids.
wtf   how is this teacher not fired
lmao i love the title for this one
that explains toad s voice actually
after we stopped laughing at it  can we fire the teacher
well damn  i guess samus  possibly my favorite game series  is actually a trans icon and the end of metroid dread is an alegory for transitioning since spoiler                                                                  she becomes a metroid.
sometimes  i feel like common sense has left the world
sorry but i m glad that i don t live in america  haven t come across much of this over here in ireland. however i did come across my first email in work last month that had pronouns in the signature
if my kid came home and told me that i would be like umm what don t think your going to that school anymore. wow
i guess the game developers gonna have to defined their characters sexuality now just to prevent the crazies to associate their crazy believes on to these characters.
member when we used to think the teachers lived at school and just never left lol i member
birdo being trans is actually canon. it s the original booklet that came with super mario bros 2. although  if i remember correctly  it s worded like  he thinks he s a girl  or something.
what the heck! this is getting outrageous! teachers need to focus on basic and advanced education and the security of kids while they are learning!!
i m sorry mario  your pronouns are in another castle.
here we go again  another south park episode becomes reality!
i used to know a girl named yoshi who could rap on a whole new level lol sorry random thought
yes  my favorite mario character princess daily!
public education has been churning out progressive ideologues for years  it s no wonder they ve been getting more aggressive in recent years as those who were trained are now in positions to do the training. anyone who wants their kids to actually be educated has to be extremely involved in their kids education anymore  even if not homeschooled. homeschool just means the kids will get more tailored lessons and attention  so it s a win in my book.
oh i hate that i share two names with her
3 57 i know the youtuber sunpi is demisexual
then they ll just get shat upon for not being inclusive enough.it s never enough.
@s. planiden  that might be true. but they should also respect those character sexuality and they would be the bigot for not doing so. isn t that their own wording  haha
the system is corrupt dude  they have their own syllabus
@smart libra  i know  it s ridiculous!
hey melonie  i always thought you were a tiny tiny person until i saw you on alex stine 99. you re not short at all..
the only character that can be interpreted as canonically is birdo  a pink yoshi looking character with a pink bow  who in the manual of the game he was featured in  is male.
can you give me your friends profile name on screen so i can look her up  i couldn t hardly hear when you gave the info at the end of your video. so sad what happened to her  i m reaching out with my prayers her to find peace  comfort and happiness.
not even yoshi is safe. why does the world have to be like this. he s just a happy dinosaur who loves cookies
bruh the title alone got meh already lgbtqrstuv123 sounds like a gamer tag i would have made back in my xbox 360 days for a free week trial
i was talking to my mum about this stuff the other day. like why the hell is sexuality a topic in schools and culture in general. it s such a weird thing to be at the forefront of serious topics. it s way worse in usa then australia but it s rubbing off over here due to social media. it s borderline grooming.
nevermind that yoshi is a reptile  which don t have mammary glands.
shipping  has been a problem from the beginning honestly
some of us men can be emotional too melonie. i m going through a break up and i m not psyched about it. playing metroid prime remastered on switch. looking for a make cane corso roman mastiff puppy to be my house guard and buddy
it s funny until it s your kid in that class.
yo dude wtf
love the shirt i m also a huge godzilla fan
as someone who s trying for a kid  i m honestly very irritated at the amount of explaining and correcting i m going to have to be doing when freaks like this are pushing this crap onto my kids
in my days poly was a threesome.  guess i m just old
actually birdo from super mario 2 was trans.it was written right in the little booklet that came with the nes game cartridge.ah  nes cartridges  i miss when blowing in those things was all it took to make technology work.
i joined kara lynne s twitch channel.its really sad what happened to her  -
saying mario is gay is like saying luke skywalker is gaythy aren t
these people reek of insecurity of how small this faction really is.
based on statistics alone  it d be very unlikely that all mario characters would be members of the lgbtqrstuv123. maybe one or two at the most  but definitely not yoshi  since he s an animal
wow  they will literally try to rewrite the history of anything
i mean teaching kids sex ed and to accept people who may be different is sort of a key but this is odd.
@martian lives matter  sex ed can t be taught by parents to everyone sheltered kids exist because of parents refusing to even let kids know sex or anything which is more risky than just teaching them.besides kids will find out on their own eventually.
@martian lives matter  accepting people for who they are is something schools have not always done anyways nor society.
@martian lives matter  space travel will not come from crops what are you saying even we will likely never even achieve seeing the galaxy in several centuries since in order to do that sir you need something called ftl travel which stands for faster than light.we cannot traverse stars billions of lightyears away with just farming all the time if we can t even do it with actual space rockets.
@martian lives matter  musk just wants to get to mars thats not traversing the galaxy anyways.nor as long of a trip as other distant stars would take.and besides i don t even like the guy much myself anyways
@chandller burse  technically sex should be for procreation and only between a husband and wife. there s been a lot of wisdom and knowledge lost through thousands of years of wars. our entire way if life has been determined for the most part by wars. large scale monoculture is was all about feeding armies. villages and towns were created to huddle around in confined space to safeguard from roaming bandits and armies. it s all because of war. a lot has changed in the last 5000-10000 years. there s was even a time when humans lived around other hominid species. meaning there were literally other species of humans that lived on this planet even when us homo sapiens were. atleast 3 others and maybe more.my original point is our ideologies and paradigms regarding sex aren t necessarily conducive to a truly healthy life. it s spawned many illnesses and vile types of people. there needs to be many new paradigms realised and it s quite amazing how they can only come from within better not give people time to contemplate then . a paradigm shift cannot be forced.
@martian lives matter  sex is also for love making even god permits this not just procreation.
@martian lives matter  to also be fair.gay people have and will continue to exist.we cannot stop them nor enforce them i feel.
@chandller burse  mycelium grows to the shape of it s food. and you don t need to go faster then light you just need the light to move around you faster. meaning you don t move the universe does. this will be achieved using vacuums and black holes. farming is kind of stupid. it s hard work when you can design your space to look after itself. when you re hungry walk out through your land and listen to what your soul tells you it wants to eat. straight from the tree plant into your mouth.
@martian lives matter  also how will we get access to blackholes of which do not exist here on earth also blackholes aren t teleporters we don t know where they go exactly but likely we die if we did go in them so i have no idea what you are talking about blackholes would destroy the entire planet if big enough anyways if i am not wrong.
@chandller burse  i m not  follower  of christianity or any other abrahamic religion. it s essentially a religion designed to create bio-robots whom were preprogrammed thousands of years ago. i don t think many people know that moses and his tribe the levites and those who he deemed were easily swayed killed the rest of all the jewish tribes at the foot of mount sinai. then they went on their 40 year trek which is close to 2 generations which was enough time for everyone to forget their previous way of life. then you got jesus some 1000 years later trying to make his people aware of this and save them. which it then was co opted by others and eventuated into christianity as a tool and it pretty much conquered the world. few hundred years after christianity you got mohammed seeing how powerful it is and what had been done and decided to use it too  walah islam. i m more an omnist because i find a lot of deeper truths in all religion and believe they do all contain truth just not the whole truth. if you have to give me an ism schism then i follow the ideological and philosophical teachings of anastasia from the ringing cedar series which has been dubbed anastasiaism
@martian lives matter  so you re just insane
@martian lives matter  okay but how is any of that going to fucking come from us working the land  which by the way is farming.
@auran crash  indeed they will. i legit said that to my mum too. they re going way overboard. people will get fed up with their drama constantly being pushed to the forefront. next minute gay bashing will be a normal thing again.
@chandller burse  i haven t been trolling but that was sarcasm  we ve touched upon some very deep topics. too deep for superficial comment section.
mario is not gay in donkey kong mario had a girlfriend pauline.this teacher know nothing about nintendo or video games history.
this person needs a restraining order to keep them at least 100m away from minors.
what can be done about teachers sexually interfering with kids       lets just say that gary plauch  is a great man and a wonderful father.
this is nuts. this whole thing is basically fan fiction that she s trying to enforce on others.
i smell a lawsuit brewingedit  i said this once and i ll say it again this is grooming at this point and i m sick of it.
the authentic nintendo trans character is kirby  the guy doesn t stop trans forming
...can we somehow get nintendo to sue her
as a gay man .this. is. ridiculous!! why do they need to give everyone a lgbt label ! i m sorry to everyone. but all of the original lgbt people only wanted to be able to get marry. the rest is just pointless and stupid.
who else remembers when super mario 2 came out and inside the manual   birdo  the egg spitter boss  was described as a  male who thinks he s female   nintendo has since called the character female.
this is just another side effect of social media and dating apps
luigibtq
lately  any source is not safe from shipping what so ever. it was innocent at first with kids but a majority of the shipping are coming from adults ranging from early to mid 20 s who don t have anything productive to do with their lives. they see two characters and immediately make up a head canon that they believe is canon and will make it their job to let everyone know that this is right and everyone is wrong. and if you don t see it their way  you are against them and are a threat.
it s one thing when a teacher tries to push an agenda  but if said teacher just straight up gets certain things wrong  that s going too far.  how can mario and peach be gay when they are a couple   mario was literally about to propose to her in  super mario odyssey .
lgbtq...rstuv.  this had me laughing my ass off! pretty soon every letter in the alphabet is gonna have an acronym associated with it. i can barely keep up with it already  lol! gonna use this from now on instead.
i hope this finds its way into nintendo offices and they sue her into oblivion for copy right infringement or whatever applies. what the hell
...the teacher has a bigger imagination than the children...
know what i learned in middle school  how to run radio club and how to properly handle algebra.no  coming out  or anything. let s keep it that way.
teacher   kids  lets talk about mario characters sexual identity nintindo feds   pounds on class room door   nib! open up!!!!   nintindo feds crash through windows  door  ceiling
a bug s lifewoke  are you saying i m stupid  everyone else  yess!
the only confirmed mario characters that are anything like this are birdo and vivian but these fools don t care about that fact.
rofl!!!
i mean as a 20 year old from what i hear working a dead end job in a bad home economy probably would get you online every day to just do something else not sure about sexuality stuff.
my 5 year old starts school this year   yup  definitely getting homeschooled. i am buying all the things i need to get him started   fuuuuuuck that shit.
i guess because yoshi  defaults male  and lays eggs that hatch into 1 ups when you collect 5 yoshi coins
so this is where fandom problems begin........
this is why i wish normies didn t know about gaming
i want to see how long many numbers and letters in their name are going to be.
if anyone is poly  it d have to be peach.  or are we forgetting that time in super mario sunshine when bowser jr. called her his mother and she had to think about it   but seriously  leave our video game friends alone.  especially the over-the-top cartoony ones like mario.and keep your sick paws off of our kids.  the teachers of today are the strangers that my mom used to tell me not to take rides from.
jeremy from geeks and gamers sure does look a little different.
it s rampant  it s like everyday  i m afraid to open the internet.
so can we be quasi-sexual  partial-sexual  and the one they have on furture-rama  robo-sexual
is this why so many people wanting to open up relationships
the most ridiculous thing yet
idk  there might be some basis for this in the lore... luigi is pretty light in the loafers as evidenced in super mario bros 2   super mario bros the lost levels.and yoshi is definitely a power bottom.
mario  i ma get some beef!
tolkien said it best   evil cannot create  it can only corrupt.   paraphrased .
look how they massacred my boy
shigeru miyamoto has gone on record and stated he is not sure if yoshi is male or female  because of course he s a  fictional character
based on the fact mario was released in the mid 1980s they were probably modelled on 70s prn stars with those massive moustaches and the fact they were plumbers lol certainly has more potential than this other stuff lolsucks you have to say this but   please bear in mind i m joking i know originally luigi or both were possibly carpenters and i m only joking and making fun at the absolute absurdity of it all
we need to normalize home schooling again
reality has become alice in wonderland
i thought yoshi was like the nameks of dragon ball z  they produce their own eggs. yoshi is not trans. maybe birdo  but even birdo makes his own eggs so not trans. they are like cells that don t have sex.
nintendo is so quick in sueing people for using  his ips for trivial motives so i hope they will sue the hell outta this teacher for twisting mario saga.
do you know why i didn t decide to have kids   because of all this madness!  and then i m criticized by my brother-in-law s babava
just for the record  no one thought that low self esteem was a problem before this country was brainwashed by psychology.
we need a law that punishes teachers who do this shit  as far as im concerned this is a form of grooming
hey kids  you think mario went to the castle to save peach  nope  he just wanted to shlob bowzer s knob. you thought yoshi was a reptile  nope  yoshi had mammary glands before but had them removed. obviously!
is this teacher not aware that nintendo are the disney of video games  if miyamoto seen what she was doing he d have a few choice words about the fact that s not how nintendo created those characters  in court
annnnnnnnnnd to no ones surprise  her account is set to private. this woman is projecting harder than a actual projector machine
i hope she gets fired and nintendo sues her.
the only lgbtq character i can recall is birdo. birdo and yoshi were romantically involved at one point.
this teacher isn t fooling anyone cuz one of the first things that a kid learns about the mario series is that mario and peach are a couple and peach in almost every mainline game in the series gives mario an affectionate kiss on the nose and i m pretty sure that they also learn as well at a young age that daisy and luigi are a couple as well cuz nintendo was going for an opposites attract type of dynamic with them with luigi being shy and timid while daisy is more brash and outgoing and in mario power tennis daisy even calls luigi  sweetie  after she wins a tennis tournament in the game. also nintendo confirmed daisy is a tomboy but apparently in today s day and age if you re a tomboy you re automatically assumed bi which is stupid because there are straight tomboy girls out there.
why is she not fired for even bringing up anything even remotely close to this topic        if a teacher was telling me stiff like this in k-12 i would have had them fired if old enough or had mom do it instead. gross!!!
oh my goodness...yeah  this is pretty messed up.  i saw this on twitter and yeah at this point it doesn t surprise me.  i m trying to figure out how in the heck this teacher came to these ridiculous conclusions  but really i don t think i want to know what kind of bizarre fan fiction she s reading.i ve already made the decision to do homeschooling whenever i have kids.  i thought about becoming a substitute teacher but stuff like this basically shot that out of the water  i don t want to be a part of a system that supports things like this.  i went through public schools myself and i don t believe i ever got exposed to anything like this  but yeah this new stuff and other things i dealt with in high school basically eliminate public schools as an option for me!!!
this is a case i would support nintendo s overly litigious lawyers coming after someone s  community  project
thank god i live in a right to work state . if my employees so much as talk to me wrong   i can fire them because it s my right . i m not a horrible boss that does that but you are fired automatically if you get your hair colored and septum pierced . i pay people to check social media  too. you don t get far around me   i shut that down as soon as i start to see it .
this is what teachers teach nowadays  i guess they are prepping kids for a gender studies degree in college.
we live in clown world. these people are a disgrace to society.
this unneeded sexualization of a video game about a plumber who saves a princess from a turtle-dragon makes the live action film look amazing now.
why do we have to assign sexuality to every character created  i m thinking there must be weirdos out there that must have sexual fantasies about these characters.
there s only two trans characters i accept in the marioverse birdo   vivian
as a  uk  schoolteacher  i would sincerely like to apologise for this  and all the other  sort of nonsense views that some of my colleagues   coworkers   hold  and the c  p we re made to teach  on behalf of the uk  and us  government and all schools  in both countries ....
same i don t wanna bring kids into this f   ed up world at this point
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   not worth it
we have too many people anyways.
yeah this world is screwed man. we have no hope
i think it s pretty clear that this  teacher  has no basis for her claims about these mario characters.  she s just using them to groom the kids in her classes by making her gender ideology part of characters they know and love.   teachers like her need to be removed from any position where they have influence over kids.
mario would not kill himself billions of times to save peach in multiple adventures if it turned out he was gay. that s all there is to it.
it s sad how these alphabet soup parasites can t even leave innocent video game franchises like mario alone.
middle school teacherthat s a weird way of describing a groomer.
i know the system is hurting for teachers but we don t need to be hiring alfabet people   i use that term lightly  who don t want to actually teach but teach their agenda instead of academics.
teacher  your favorite mario character is ga- gets hit with a dart and passes out.nintendo  how kids should our shyguy here wake your teacher or do you wanna play some nintendo games!!!!kids  nintendo games!!!!that kid  ps5 for life!!! gets sent out.that other kid  free melee!! is given and old scratched up copy of melee and is also sent out.
this is why we should homeschool our future children from creepy teachers. this is so ridiculous!
birdo from super mario bros. 2 really is canonically trans  according to the manual.
i clean a high school part time in new zealand. we for a few yrs now have unisex  trans friendly  toilet blocks . i can  imagine the issues this cause. i had no idea we had trans students   can t be many in a school of 800 or so. yet they aren t getting their own cubicle even. female and trans stamped cubicle! weird.
if you are trying to find something  you will often find exactly what you re looking for. she wants to see gay in characters  so she finds it. just like people who see the american flag and say it stands for racism  it s because they are ignoring the other 99  of good that the flag represents and see what they want to.
you know if you wanna be technical yoshi is female and birdo despite wearing a bow and being pink with eyelashes is the male counter part of the yoshi species as it shoot unfertilised blank eggs out of its mouth as yoshi eats the prey with its tongue and plops out the eggs with spots on it .
no mention of birdo  the super mario bros. 2 manual straight up said birdo is a guy who thinks he s a girl. this detail about birdo s also been used as a joke in the franchise more than once.
yoshi is like godzilla he can lay eggs
mario is gay  yeah so about that.... i just watched a video about all the times peach kissed mario and he liked it every time. peach being lesbian  no because she clearly likes mario  and mario likes her back. yoshi being trans  are they trying to sexualize a dinosaur   the answer is yes . what is going on in this messed up world today
can we please teach kids personal finance and the viability of trade programs and tech certifications instead please  thank you for calling this shiz out.
what s hilarious is they are basically saying the vast majority of the right are  demisexual . so  the right is more lgbt than the left
as conservative as i am i actually will say yoshi is female  in mario party 9 when you play 2 v 2  your teams have cool names that describe the characters you re playing as  and yoshi s was tomboy
nintendo about to go to school to arrest the teacher.
this does not reflect upon nintendo nor illumination. i won t be surprised if the alphabet cult goes after the super mario bros. movie but we must remain vigilant and stand up for children.
it was a translation error. vivian is a girl worldwide. there are zero woke agendas in the super mario franchise. japanese kirby tended to get more mature without going overboard.
illumination made minions they are already an abomination themselves.
yoshi was never trans  it was birdo from mario 2 that the booklet says he dresses as a female
i like this quote to describe these teachers who push these philosophies onto kids   most of the major ills of the world have been caused by well-meaning people who ignored the principle of individual freedom  except as applied to themselves  and who were obsessed with fanatical zeal to improve the lot of mankind-in-the-mass through some pet formula of their own. the harm done by ordinary criminals  murderers  gangsters  and thieves is negligible in comparison with the agony inflicted upon human beings by the professional do-gooders  who attempt to set themselves up as gods on earth and who would ruthlessly force their views on all others with the abiding assurance that the end justifies the means.   henry grady weaver  the mainspring of human progress
they seek the affirmation of children because they know adults won t give it to them. pathetic disgrace for human beings. the  teacher  isn t even old enough to speak about back in the day mario.
we already knew birdo was is a transvestite but dammit  why do the t   q branch of the woke mob have to take on everything that people love ... no need to respond why since we know the obvious answer of them being miserable so everyone has to be... also because of their recent tomboy trans logic  i m surprised they didn t go there with daisy. and don t get me started on rainbow road  lol.to that person  since yoshi is  trans   he was probably first named yoshe... now i wouldn t be surprised if he d turn yo-shy guy after hearing this. and let me guess  bowser is actually a straight white male in some costume. i d probably add that he d be pay-doe but we all know they want  people of the playground   won t call them that other terminology they want to instore...  to be normalized...also  hope the best for kara lynne. being sacked sucked but being sacked because of politics is stupid. which is again  very hypocritical because if it was a radleftist woke  we wouldn t hear the end of it with them boohoo whining   crying as the media would most likely cover it...
this teacher needs a sanatorium instead of a classroom.  dahek
i have never seen mario bros. be sexual in any way  it is a computer game with challenges for everybody  the target audience is everybody.  we see this middle school teacher projecting into superficial features  to assume anything other than normal male and female roles.  there is a psychological thing about drawn  painted  and animated characters  the more ambiguous  then the more people you can attract  until you are drawing stick figures  because people are projecting their personal values into the characters.  the downside of being completely ambiguous is that your message is also broad  and likely boring  it is why there are a few stick figure cartoons.  moreover  the more detailed your characters  then the smaller the audience  with the benefit you can give a message there for your cultivated audience.  what makes mario bros. function is the characters live in a multiverse fantasy realm  that means existentialism has power there  therefore  people don t latch onto their identities as much  because it is meaningless  and you can enjoy the game  that is the center theme that holds the story together.
teachers should never tell children what to think about politics or social ideologies. that is up to the child s parents guardians. then when the child gets older  they can choose their own opinions. teachers should stick to educational curriculum.
i think it needs to get permission from japan before it decides to make changes to nintendo s characters
mario is gay  but he chases after peach and saves her time and time again  yep. okay. i believe you  buttercup.and yoshi is trans in the loudest adam sandler yelling voicehe s a fuuuuckin cartooooon dinoooosaauuuur! jeeeesuuus chriiiiissttt!
i think birdo was the only one that was a boy dressed as a girl but not sure how much of that was ever official
there s alot about this article that seems fishy to me.   first  the daily mail is an english newspaper  and why is an english newspaper writing about something happening in new york city. i did find this article in a new york paper. that paper is the new york post which is new york city s equivalent to the enquirer.     the article says she teaches at the new york city department of education. the  doe  is an administrative body  no one is actually teaching there. and this article doesn t give the name of an actual school where this teacher works.     and this is an afterschool program   so new york city parents are letting their kids sit around after school so some nut can tell them about this one is gay this one is bi and what ever     and this person also has pride flags on her desks  and tells her students about who she goes around having sex with   and not 1 parent has heard about this and complained about it        i think some hack saw someone post something stupid on twitter and turned it into a news story.
what are we doing  this is why america is falling behind other countries as far as education goes. that time could have been spent towards teaching the youth of the country towards something much more meaningful.
the closest i can even think of to an lgbt character is birdo  who s a male but spits eggs and looks very feminine. i could see saying that s sort of trans  but other than that it s incredibly stupid. mario and pauline used to be together in the donkey kong arcade and he and bowser literally fight over peach at the end of odyssey. yep  totally gay alright. peach has also kissed him  before  so it s not entirely one-sided.
this is straight up grooming
i don t think that the world is ending  it s been over. does a video game character s sexuality really matter  this reminds me of a joke.  hey teach  what is the fastest way to get fired
i m sorry  but the yoshi is trans meme is pretty funny. he s a male character that lays eggs.
can someone say  red flag   she should be removed from her role purely based on her poly agenda with her students. this is a huge red flag on her potentially seducing students.   if i were an administrator in that district  i would be immensely concerned about a future lawsuit.  and they would deserve every bit of retribution in such an instance if it happened.
i m thanking the lord that the franchise owned by japanese people so we don t need to see a shipwreck of a childhood favorite
this school teacher mustve have mistaken birdo with yoshi  he is male from what i remember lol
they have to push polyamorous as its the only way they can explain these people being shown in official sources as straight. they re not straight they re gay polyamorous. except with things like luke where a short story published in the past year or two overides years of homosexual monogomous marriage which has been deemed non-canon. funny how that works.
if its already over why is this species still alive i was promised extinction .
@chandller burse  we are living in purgatory!
love that title.
argh!!!they never stop..
i wonder if the ny school board is aware of this
just point and laugh at the craziness going on
at this rate i fear someone will try to say guts likes guys.    oie
teacher  these nintendo characters are gayjapanese  bahahahahahah
yeahhh imma need some sources for these claims
so the whole toad species is trans  what about the toadettes luigi isn t queer  he s based  so yeah he wants an emotional connection.the only thing i can think for daisy is she s a tomboy  but tomboys can be straight and almost always are. where s the poly  that mario rescued her once  but she likes luigi  sometimes a guy doesn t get anything for saving a girl from aliens because she likes his brother instead. mario s a big boy  he moves on to chase a new woman when he is turned down.i don t think peach even knows what sex or sexuality are. she was too sheltered and probably strings mario along because she doesn t understand either of their feelings. she seemed completely baffled by bowser jr saying she was his mother.yoshis are confirmed hermaphrodites  they have 1 sex and reproduce by eating!the best case they could probably make besides birdo is bowser being closet gay.
come on daisy too she s one of the original tomboys
this is what happens when you cut sports and music programs.
i think the teacher is opening up the state to be sued by nintendo.
birdo in super mario bros 2 was the one that was maybe trans. the manual said birdo was a boy  but he s a little confused  and thinks she s a girl. that game came out when i was in 6th grade  and we all thought that was hilarious.
that is an extremely 90 s top - did you buy an estate sale from the movie  10 things i hate about you     pre-tr... man  sounds as dumb as those people who were calling indie bands post post-rock or pre post-hardcore  around the new wave cafe and cole s if you were there . like  our influences are whoever influenced fugazi and the bands that fugazi influenced but not fugazi  loooooool.  but  instead of  the jesus lizard   the band name is  yoshiwithboobs   courtesy of melonie . its getting harder to listen to these at work without stopping to crack up  good video
it s funny but also  on a serious note grooming.
i tried to watch the new season of south park and i didn t find it funny because our reality is topping south park. we really have reached the point where comedy is writing it s self.
it s very strange that she felt the need to assign these arbitrary labels to all of these characters who clearly aren t what she labeled them. when birdo is literally a thing in the mario universe  there is already a trans character in mario. you don t need to make things up haha
mamma mia letzz goo mario!
what a pervert.  leaves kids and their stories alone.  the manholes in mario games are just practical sewer access!  is yoshi s dong in a medical-waste receptacle somewhere in the mushroom kingdom   when will toad be old enough to mutilate   and what a coincidence that the historical love interest has no interest in men.  classy stuff!
parents  you should not put up with this.go to your local school board and fight this nonsense.as an aside  if nintendo caves to this  the company will be dead to me.
these people think they are being  activists  by just making up stuff about video game characters....yoshi is a boy  and has a girl friend named birdo   the pink yoshi  this chick is for sure a furry and i bet uses made up pronouns  only a person like that would even bother to chart out the gender identity and sexual orientation of maro bros. characters....
as a mario fan i can confirm yoshi is not trans he is a dinosaur and mario is not gay neither is peach a lesbian
it s absolutely silly what s happening in the us education system. 13 26 fyi  here in europe  in most states almost every school is an institution of the state. idk exactly how the us education system works  but here teachers have to follow a strict curriculum. teaching any crap like this lgbtq teacher would immediately lead to suspension.
guaranteed when this teacher was a teen she was one of those cringy fans who roleplay as fictional characters and ships the characters she likes in anime. i know y all may like anime but i swear it s a contributing factor to these weirdos
yoshi is a dinosaur. nintendo will not be pleased with this so-called  teacher s  presentation.
we hope someday that it goes away. but who knows maybe it won t maybe it ll just keep getting worse and worse.
another teacher who shouldn t be anywhere near children  in my opinion. mario is male. luigi is male  peach and daisy are female. clearly the teacher is playing some pirate version of the game or is just delusional.  thank you  melonie.
hey  i didn t know there was a 3 in there. i want to be a 3 too.i expect respect!
if these people have to assign an lgbt  identity to all of these characters  here s one letter that would fix the lot  a. as in  asexual   as in  not interested in sex   because there is no damn sex amongst children s video game characters! mario is a happy jumping plumber. he isn t interested in sex. luigi is a scaredy-cat plumber  he also isn t interested in sex  probably because the thought of stds freaks him out . peach and daisy are princesses  they also aren t interested in sex. toad and toadette are mushroom-people  they probably reproduce by spores  they definitely aren t interested in sex. i suppose yoshis might be interested in sex  simply because they re animals  but they have the common decency to keep it offscreen. if people want to play out their weird sexual super mario fantasies  that s fine - there s a thing called fan fiction. write them  read them  be as kinky as you want.  in the actual games  however  you are never going to see the slightest smidgen of sex  because a  they re for kids  and b  they re japanese  and the japanese do not put up with this western bs. you play super mario to rescue princesses  fight dragon-ogres  play sports and go-kart - you do not do it for sex. therefore  they are not sexual beings  thank you  weird  teacher -lady  i ve just done your thinking for you.
to be fair  demi doesn t just mean only if there s an emotional connection  but it also means the demi could have a sexual relationship with either gender. just felt compelled to say that given my history writing a character who s demisexual.
someone....please....make this make sense
this is claiming this teacher doesn t know anything about mario  which feels disrespectful to the franchise.
12 30freaking ameeeen exactly
k seriously here s how stupid this is if you re honestly going to seriously make a case over a mario character being trans and you don t pick birdo . like this is stupidity on so many levels.
the only canonically lgbt  character in the mario franchise is birdo  from super mario bros. 2. the instruction manual for that game describes birdo as  a boy who thinks he s a girl   which could be a late 80s way of describing a trans person. however  it still suggests that gender identity dysphoria is a delusion at best  and that a person s gender is not just whatever that person believes themselves to be  but actually based in biological reality. so even that little factoid is not what the woke crowd aspires to be. the rest of what this woman says is utter nonsense and directly contradicted by all mario games  cartoons  comics  and other media. she s lucky nintendo doesn t sue.
this  teacher  sounds like she s never played a mario game in her life! sounds to me like the  teacher  found some fan art and mistook it for game canon or something. facepalm.
how is yoshi trans  he s a lizard  they don t think about gender the same way we humans do!
the humanity!
in a way this teacher does have a point when you take birdo into consideration  a character that s said to be gender ambiguous even by nintendo themselves.overall the assumption of sexual identity is nothing new as japanese entertainment whether you re talking about videogames or anime and i could point to man example in japanese games and anime from ranma 1 2  metal gear  etc
2 02 imma keep it simple with you. this teacher is entirely wrong  as the mario multimedia franchise has never had any lgbtq  characters  but i ve got a bone to pick with you. you made fun of the enby  nonbinary  community at timecode 2 02 and i will not stand for it. they them pronouns have been used for centuries  and all of the sudden  you are getting mad at people for it  i m nonbinary  and proud to be such. i m not gonna stop you from being cisgender  staying your assigned gender as it was at birth   but you have to stop being offensive like this. the literal title of this video alone is bullying the lgbtq  community. i admit  it is funny  but that isn t respectful to good and decent people. i m just furious that you would think that it would be polite to upload something that is intentionally offensive. stick to nice and respectful  family friendly content.
i see they are using the term  teacher  very loosley
bowser is not gay. he never was  and he never will be. mario said  so long kinga bowser. and bowser is always after peach no matter what.
@photriuspyrelus  okay  i just explained what it actually means. how does that equate to endorsement over the insanity teachers and others try to push on kids
i m sure they ll have yoshi cancelled for pooping out yoshi eggs and throwing them at others in no time.
what funny is there are trans characters in nintendo   birdo   that ghost witch from paper mario on the gamecube  can not remember her name   plus other lgbt characters   there even one or two  in kirby   they always get censored in north america   and other countries
i can t say what i want most likely without getting a ban. instead i ll just say  go boom
when mental illness isn t treated and they think their delusions are real and teacher unions want taught to our kids
how long were you home-schooled until you went to real school  just asking for when i have kids.
to every question you asked in this video grooming.
12 40 we should have gatekept harder
they like to call us normies. i like to refer to them as abnormies. or a whats-it.
ummm...italian plumber that looks mexican  is a plumber that teleports through pipes  to save a princess and stomp on shrooms  punches bricks...is the boyfriend of said princess  has a straight brother  and a friend with a mushroom hat  named toad. i will be homeschooling my sister for the foreseeable future. will also be homeschooling my own children some day.better to stand apart from the world  than to be part of the madness.
...maybe it s a case of mario is rubber...and she is glue...
this jeremy lady sounds like she had something on her mind and her grown click didn t hear her out so it stewed and fermented until she walked into class one day and let it rip on the kids. unprovoked or overheard a kid mention something that loosely connects to it.
that s a lot of letters numbers now.
that teacher is twisting the minds of children - she should be immediately fired  and criminal charges filed.this is not acceptable in the slightest.  get rid of that teacher immediately.  and never let her around kids again.  her actions are blatantly criminal.
actually.............birdo was a cross dresser. its in the old nes super mario bros 2 game instruction manual.  yeah. i think they dropped that part for future games lol
i had a kirby commercial before this video
how old is she
everyone knows mario is into sonic c mon now
lol i thought mario and peach have a cannon daughter
i thought demisexual was  needing to have an emotional connection  but it can be anyone . like bisexual with removed hook-ups.
word from the wise mr. s. he has said those who can t do teach and those who can t teach teach.gym
home schooling  asap.
the poor kids and games  mostly the kids and the girl you was talking about at the end of your video .  they shouldn t have teachers like that in school.
they don t care about anything other than trying to make a mark on the world.
yeah find the video and tag nintendo in it pretty sure the creators of the product are extremely protective of their ip
this is the exact reason why that bill was passed in florida.
toad is just toad wtf
would be funny if nintendo sue the school.
ok.... this is too much internet for me..i m going back to my word search paperbook puzzles.. which sharpens my mind  that s a fact it says it on the book
it s like unearthing a long buried post on tumblr that has been discussed 10 years ago  and uploaded to tiktok... oh. we found her source material  plagiarization!
this  has gone too far. leave our beloved properties alone!!!!!
these people belong in jail.
melanie  nothing is going to change until feces start hitting the butter
these teachers need to be removed from teaching kids anything....
yoshi s not even human 0 59
already done. no sick woke monsters around my child
what a reach haven t seen anyone reach so hard since elsa
this is the definition of pushing identity politics.
how are these people teachers check our colleges and universities for the answer to that question .
lgbtqrstuv123  ello-meno-p
i fear this will not go away until gen z has destroyed itself and our families. to many resources have been devoted to making our country week from the inside through our education system.
could the alphabet thieves not be creepy with kids  i know they won t unless we force them to
this  teacher  belongs in bellevue hospital  not in a school. get her out of there. now.
america is under attack we need to hold these sick people accountable!!!
these people are indirectly teaching kids about sex at a very young age.  that is not why parents put their kids in school in the first place.
going against human nature is trendy and cool to younger people and they have extreme inferiority complex issues so they try to bring their imaginary worlds into reality which is both entertaining and irritating.
why are these teachers talking to kids about sexual identities  i think there s a word for that  starts with a g.
why are we allowing creepy predators to teach kids in school
she needs to watch it. nintendo doesn t mess around with their products.
i thought sex was a private matter  look where we ve come in the space of a generation! what we do in the bedroom is now everyone s business.
where s nintendo s cease and desist order  they do it for so much normal content i m shocked they re not suing this person...
why is this relevant in schools or needs to be teached ! !
mario  i am all about saving the princess so long gy bowser
insanity is on the loose  protect your children at all
whats the story with her tattoescause i heard shes a woman of god
welp... i am very lucky that gay teachers i met from elementary to high school won t do something like this.these kinds of people had gone too far...and it s disgusting
the only  poly  they should teach is polygons  polyester and that kind of thing.
the only good thing about lgtbqrstlkuv489 is that you can go full madness with your keyboard  releasing some anxiety from the day
she s not providing evidence - she s suggesting they were always gay in their initial design according to stereotypes she s noticed  not that they came out at some point
that s enough. this community is predatory and i don t care how many times any of them say  its not most of us   too many of you have shown your true colors too many times now.
all these  polly  relationships and no parrots involved what-so-ever. weird.
i want to homeschool my son.. you mentioned you were homeschooled. do you have any advice or suggestions  my son is 4
rstuv123  what the hell is that
no... i definitely did not forget.
wait whats rsuv123       they just keep adding letters....can anyone keep up
evil needs anything to corrupt
there s mario mario and luigi mario.
yoshi is a species.
what subject do these teachers teach fir them to bring up such a topic. which curriculum is this
confused thinking on display  teacher not mel
hi melly big mac with extra sauce!!
i wished yoshi eat this teacher like in video games he does  d
if mario is gay  the. why the hell has he spent most of his career trying to save a princess !!
nintendo has sued for less
brainworms  simply put brainworms
no mam  i didn t see you playing with your yoshi dolls again...
princess peach  is my all favorite
he   him   his
they are so lucky it wasn t in my schools wasn t teaching this crap was teaching history geography science mathematics working out gym classes. lunchroom was the ghetto spot. i don t know what the hell they do today for what i was told they buy their lunch outside. but they not supposed to teach this s    to kids if the kids bring this teaching to the parents might file a report what s going on in school and nobody wants to get fired cuz if they do don t play the victim
anyone who has 3 first names is not to be trusted.
melanie help me please tell me yoshi with a giant rack isn t real and can t hurt me.
yes i was homeschooled until i went to college  it was a wonderful experience i am so grateful for! i wondered if i missed out at one point  but hindsight 20 20 i definitely didn t lol! my best advice is to make sure your son has plenty of social opportunities because homeschooling can be isolating. a good curriculum is crucial of course  but mom always did fun stuff with my brothers and i  took us to museums  farms  nature walks  etc as part of  school.  we only needed like 2-4 hours a day of the actual teaching  homework part and we were all way ahead academically  usually only had 4 school days a week on average too   so it worked out great. i had two brothers and that helped a lot to have built in friends  but things like youth group or homeschool groups if there are any nearby were very nice too. the biggest downside of homeschooling is the lack of getting out  socializing  etc  so if you can find ways to incorporate getting out of the house and also having your son socialize with other kids once a week or so it helps a lot! i think that s amazing that you want to homeschool him
i just added those as a joke lol
well im pretty sure he s a boy always threw me off that he made eggs and uses them as weapons but i don t think that nintendo care in the slightest he s pretty fun been awhile since i played yoshi s island i think i got a gameboy version somewhere.
magikoopa looks a bit map.
isn t this now illegal in florida
i was looking for some leather with some cut offs and blue hair on peach but honestly im not seeing it
if he s gay then y was he trying 2 get some of the princess s peach
teacher be like  yoshi is trans lgbtqrstuv123me  well seven is a cannibal . because 7 8 9.
nintendo has sued people for using their characters for far less.
okay so  daisy might be called lesbian because of her relationship with peach    they re best friends  nothing more. no one can be in straight friendships anymore smh. what is even going on anymore  they re not going after my favourite characters now wtf. mario likes peach  peach likes mario. we ve seen that plenty of times in the games. luigi is hinted to have a crush on daisy  and the feelings are mutual. daisy is a huge tomboy  that does not mean she s a lesbian. the claims with toad and yoshi are also absurd. the only one i can say is birdo. their gender is left ambiguous  i think.dude  she is confusing established lore with fanfiction. actually  i ve read better fanfiction. this is just pure cope and delusion.edit  almost forgot the fact that mario s ex was pauline before taking interest in peach. how the fuck is he gay lmaooo
so it turns out now that samus was a man allllll this time.
their stuff is so whack  i m not even sure if the title with the added letters and numbers is legit now
japan dont mess with that stufftheyre not anti lg but they wont make their character lgb
leave video game characters alone maybe we should bring back gatekeeping and sone slight bullying because that s wot made gamers fun
that teacher should be in prison
lol  careful. nintendo is litigious.
i wish the woke mob would just stop. i m about ready to disappear into the mountains somewhere and leave all this behind.
is it a coincidence that snl mario kart   last of us skit happened and now here s one of these jagoffs to sexualize cartoon characters
i never understood pushing your feelings onto someone else it s cool you feel that way i ll be nice about but teaching kids this it can t be real this can t be a subject in a classroom maybe senior yr  sex ed during a q an a kinda sickening is this not what grooming is imma have to look that up
i think you forgot the wxyz.  i think a bingo goes at the end too. i mean  i m not woke  but i try. ya know  sarcasim
i got to say that mario   luigi are both men and they are not gay at all and they both are working buddies who work on plumbing and mario saves princess and yosi is a dinosaur and mario rides yosi every place they go to destroys king koopa who kidnaps the princess and takes her to the castle to keep her as his princess and queen of the koopa family. anyway i just wanted to tell you that and tell you that mario and luigi are not gay and they are working buddies who work on plumbing for business  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also hope you enjoyed the movie of cocaine bear earlier today. anyway have a great evening and good nite melonie. god bless you too melonie.
homeschool your children.
i hope nintendo sues her for damaging their brand.
that is supposed to be your teacher  that s a dominatrix in training....get your kids out of that school  now!
they should just keep this whole  sex and gender crap  out of schools
why is there a school authorized sexual orientation club for students
a word of warning to these people. nintendo don t like being involved in all this social political nonsense at all and have sued for less  -
protect your children then just let the weirdos wear themselves out. none of them can will breed so we ll be out of this non-sense soon.
love how these weirdos are so arrogant that they think they can just change facts about someone else s ip. the narcissism.
is princess peach a trans-sexual no.is peach a lesbian nooo...well  you think she a hetero-se nooo!she s a digital cartoon
1.48  has this  teacher  even played mario
remember when it was just about same-sex marriage
i always figured yoshi was assexual at most lol
these weirdos are out of control
the gaslighting is what bugs me the most. they re obsessed with grooming kids and defended for it. if you complain they just say  no u  and apparently that s all that s needed to destroy your argument. it s fked up.as for the mario franchise. there s two trans people and those are birdo and that one ghost from paper mario whose name i can t remember. the game s creators have implied that the toads don t have genders. yoshis reproduce asexually and have no concept or need for sex and gender and everyone else is either straight or its kept ambiguous because the japanese don t give a damn about this.
people need to stop being so obsessed with fictional characters sexualities  it s so weird!
yoshi isn t trans but ik birdo is  it s in the game you can look it up
fire that teacher. how is yoshi trans  do they just wake up and wait a minute yoshi trans that makes sense.
here s hoping nintendo sues.
teachers like this need to be fired. their there to teach a subject not there personal politics.
technically  yoshi is gay because yoshi dates birdo  and they are both male.
this school teacher needs to keep her weird and non-canon fanfiction and leave it on wattpad where it belongs. also students don t need to know about your sexual life!!! do your job and leave your personal life out of it!
welcome to america  the largest open-air asylum for the legally-insane.
never heard of  demisexual  before today. as norm macdonald would ve said  it s a way of marginalizing normal people
this teacher needs to be arrested
in what world does this have any educational value !   fire this teacher.
what next  pacman was a lesbian ghostsexual
nice of the princess to invite us to her picnic  gay luigi
keep them away can someone think of the kids
the trans person is not the authority on nintendo characters 9 03
i dont have a gender because i identify as a ghost when i find out that we can pick what we identify as i said to make fun of them people i am a ghost with no gender
chain falls and pig pits
i m glad this is getting so ridiculous we can safely laugh at it now. lets see it spin even more out of control so we can safely ignore it too.the grooming is not cool tho. forcing any opinion on someone else  adult or not is not cool.
she and all like her should get fired and banned.
...you were home schooled...you were working from home before working from home was cool...
teachers do this because nobody else will listen to their mindless crap
lmfao   toad is a mushroom  a fungus
this teacher should be fired including every other teacher that talks about sexuality! when i was in school which i graduated in 2019! i had a teacher in high school who started talking about sexuality and the teacher got fired cause that s not a topic a teacher should be talking about! any teacher should keep their sexuality and sexuality opinions private cause it s not appropriate in a school environment! if stuff like this continues i m gonna be home schooling my future kids! i m really concerned about this generation of kids! this situation is highly inappropriate! and i don t like theses teachers trying brainwash these kids to agree with their opinions! thanks for posting this melonie!
luigi with the sqeuugee!!!
this is just fan fiction. let them have their fun. doesn t affect my engagement with this universe in any way. i do agree that this has no place in school unless perhaps as a creative writing assignment.
abolish public education.
so we all now pre-trans  prequel of trans  the prequeer  now woke dictionary is something
all these terms are getting ridiculous.
this is why children are more depressed and unhappy . children needs to be children   not brainwashed npcs!
stuff like this is not helping their cause.
stop getting triggered by some random headline you saw online
yoshi is a dinosaur  so the person that came up with this bs 1 has never played a  game  in her life and 2 shouldn t be teaching with her background when it comes to her relationships
i hope she gets fired!
like a coworker at wrigley field once told me  we gays can t have kids  so we ll just indoctrinate yours. the casualness in which that was said was frightening even back in 2003
just to be clear  peach is mario s girl  and daisy is luigi s girl. they all straight.
where are the eggs coming from  need a male and female to hatch...
it s a shame when the weirdos try to make their rule 34 fan fictions canon.
in the mario games birdo has a pink bow its a girl thats yoshi girlfriend but google says birdo is a guy because dumb people put that on google
peach and bowser are actually a couple. peach is sooo not a lesbian.
yoshi isnt even a human wtf
nintendo is pretty hardcore about their characters  they have a movie coming out  they know this kind of stuff is toxic to brands  and i m seeing this gay mario stuff everywhere this morning. would anyone be surprised if this weirdo gets sued somehow  i wouldn t.
where s birdo
yoshi is not even a mammal so why would it have boobs
dear middle school teachers stop lying to your students. lol. how pathetic.
are people who die.. are they actually dead  what do you think
man this b.s has got to stop why is everything made sexual these days.
random statements are random...
comments like these make gay people sound like an eldritch threat which to be fair i cannot say melonies audience doesn t seem to believe that sometimes.
@chandller burse  that s the lgtq political lobby for ya.
@ancestor empire  i was kind of making a statement about the people here not them.
@chandller burse  they re still supported by the tribe
@ancestor empire  what
and so is bowser.
cuz bowser like girl. straight man.
peach and bowser are actually a couple. no.
as the god of war.. i m tired of this bulls
facepalm
i have confusion fr
are you canadian
i m waiting for the clouds that bring down the id4 style blast which last time it was let loose on the earth turned lot s wife into a pillar of salt.  i m sending a message to hollyweird by watching jesus revolution tomorrow.  gonna be a good day.
she s hi.
nooooooo xd
the day i see a p in there is the day well a new color will be added crimson
wtf
yoshi and birdo setting in the tree first comes love then comes marriage yoshi is a boy birdo is a girl
they have become the bully
lgbtqia p
yoshi is a f ing dinosaur tho
this where the makers of the games need to step up and go no our characters are not this is getting beyond a joke and this person shouldn t be teaching kids at all sad times
mario characters!  now this is going too far!
it is a siiiiiiiiiicknesssss
nintendo aint gonna be happy about this crossfire.....
what about bowser
about toadsafaik  officially they are asexuellthey don t have reproductive organs like humans but how to they reproduce  no idea  maybe like  mushrooms i guess even nintendo wasn t thinking about stuff like this  when they made the games
these teachers shouldn t be teaching let alone be teachers they need to stop brain washing kids and that goes for talking about games
he is a villain  he can t be a minority
@fernando faria
toads are a race. males are toads. females are toadettes.
arkum asylum
all we can do is laugh at this stuff. im all for people following their feelings and discovering who they are  but why this obsession with labels and identity politics. why bring it into every facet of our culture. mario! ! ! are you kidding me! ! !
i played mario on the atari 2600 probably before this fool was even a conceived idea am i going to far by saying i hate them
leave mario out of this!
yoshi is a small green dinosaur
ok melonie im him they forest donkey horse badger fruit minx pig milk honey spoon goat fridge door knob its a thing like it.
who is this lady  a deviantart shipper what s her next school lesson  that sonic the hedgehog is a hermaphrodite  and tails is the pope
when donkey kong came out  and all the follow-ups  this gender nonsense wasn t a thing. they need to stop retroactively reassigning genders. and really  if people weren t taking you seriously before  they re really not going to take you seriously now.
what in the flying fu k...
what in the world
no we need to get rid of it not laugh and hope it goes away.
nah bro the pink yoshi things with the bows on their heads and tube mouths are female yoshis. the dinosaur yoshis are the male yoshis. everyone knows this since super mario 2 when the pink bow enemy came out and she was hella annoying.
there s nothing wrong with shipping characters for fun  but don t take it that seriously and make up stupid shit about them and teach that to children  wtf.
i hope nintendo sues
theyre not.. nintendo is a very conservative corp  and thats why people love it. all theit characters are straight. even if i as a bi guy had a lil crush on link   because hes heckin cute lol  i totally know that hes with the girls. marios freakin lifequest  is to freakin safe princes toadstool  his love. bayonetta is a femme fatale powerfantasy  and samus aran never was about romance. i also totally see star fox with krystal the blue fox girl from star fox adventures.and and and.nothing about any of those storys  is about that mentally ill bullshit!
this news from the daily mail is to ridiculous and laughable. i was not homeschooled mac go boom.
it s amazing what sex freaks  gay or straight  will consider as  evidence  to support whatever sexuality or fetish they themselves wish to push onto their so called favorite character s . these people a plague.
serioulsy hope nintendo sues this broad and makes her backtrack on every single bs she sewed out.
soon  nintendo fucking sues the shit out of the school direct for using their characters
you can t just tell parents to homeschool their kids. that s not a solution. that s not even a feasible option to the vast majority of families today. the problem is that we ve made teaching such a shitty job that the smartest and most qualified are going into more lucrative or prestigious lines of work. and we re left with the dregs to choose from. like  this teacher  here s something horrifying  there were dozens of applicants even worse than her. she was the best one. but if you make teaching a good job  you ll have a better pool of applicants to choose from. and a right to demand a higher standard of job performance.to put it more succinctly  you get what you pay for.
these people sexualizing everything. it s disgusting
trans yoshi lmao
is melanie a female
this is child abuse. it s that simple.
what s with the fascination of talking to pre-teens about their sexuality   that act is the definition of grooming  this woman should be arrested.
i seriously don t want to live with this rainbow reality anymore trying to force everything to go against the status quo to be queer is nonsense when does this community have any boundaries this is ridiculous
even though she is completely wrong  all of the toads have no gender. said in an interview.
this has nothing to do with educating children and everything to do with pushing a message or agenda. this is disgusting!
clown world
leave mario alone and let kids be kids they don t know about this stuff and should not know until they re older
like nintendo is ever gonna approve of this weird fetish in their games or media. nintendo has done crappy things before  but they ain t that stupid lmfao.
the abc people strike again.
sorry if this person was at my school i would be at the school bored say this person should not be teaching
all the trans people i know were home schooled.
groomers need to be removed
who the fuck is yoshi  i hear this name in mario universe first time in my entire life
another reason tic tock needs to be banned
birdo is trans....... until i think they changed him into a full fledge girl
the girl is your sjw doppleganger lol
my people are not trans. we create our population through the devouring of our enemies.
putin is right about the west.
why give long-standing characters  especially those appealing to children  a sexual orientation  why even sexualize these characters  i used to be a tolerant guy but now this kind of stuff will set me off.
cos she s selling that to kids.. what s better than say that those things what interest young people are trans
yoshis don t have genders. they hatch from eggs
he s a dude! lol
come onlah...... this and that freaks already ruined star war characters........and now they want ruined super mario characters..... they even after astafol from fate grand order and bridget from guilty gear
what i think if they keep putting these woke crap in video games im going back to playstation 2 and stay over there
sounds like you re reeeeeeeeing
welp  rip mario world. i guess everyone in that universe is gay so no procreation in that universe. what a freakin joke.
ffs
i m not gonna knock polygamy  god blessed plenty of those in the bible  and even jesus talked about 10 brides for a man  with 5 of them successfully getting married at the end of his parable  not only 1   but doing nothing but polyamorous hook ups i will insult.
yoshi is a dinosaur! why is she obsessing over yoshi s gender genetalia! leave mario alone you crazy lady
yoshi is a female obviously
needs to be a ban on forced sexual identity politics to children. put these people on a list. i guarantee all this will stop if consequences exist
that s critical race theory for you ... make all political   destroy escapism   don t let people form groups that are against your agendas   divide them ...
so some pervert is telling children her fanfics  this is why i ve always hated shipping.
so metroid is a dude then
so  just so we re all on the same page here - are the super liberals of twitter  who insist nobody assumes your gender  nor sexual preference  are all now just assuming those things
why you gotta hurt my feelings like that
@melonie mac go boom
very funny and informative vid. can t believe you responded b4 i even finished watching. very cool of you. i identify as a thwomp who s not that angry.
it s not stupid to accept gays or trans. just be kind
why does everything have to be lgbt labeled
hijacking characters again. possessive freaks
omg leave super mario bros out of this lgbtcrap!!! what is wrong with these people ! don t answer the obvious!
she s not wrong nintendo not said a long time ago. sounds like you re just trying to pearl clutch. to make it sound worse than what actually is it is very apparent to me that you do very little research.
whats going on with drag queens  trans women and cross dressing males discussing sex with minors  there is an agenda.
mental illness is bad. used to be the crazy people weren t allowed to roam around unsupervised  much less teach children.
you spelled it wrong it s the lgbtq raweyuiopsdfhjklzxcvnm  community.
any teacher that promotes this woke activism should be immediately fired. these are sick people. they shouldn t be around kids.
jeremy is a man. calling herself bisexual. she s trans
that is a dude.
mario is a simp and peach is with bowser. it s so obvious.
freak show forced ideology
is melonie conservative or right wing leaning  or central
stop with this nonsense
i miss the good ol  days when it was just gay  lesbian  bisexual. t people have nothing to do with the rest of it so not worth mentioning.
wait ..... she equated trans people to fungi  that seems very transphobic. right  isn t that how this lunacy works
a little green dinosaur  that shows no sexuality whatsoever is trans!  mario is gay!  peach is into chicks !! bloody hell  i give up.
as a gay man and a gamer  what the fuck is this
memories are mammalian.. yoshi is a lizard or dinosaur offshoot  they have eggs  yes im aware of the platypus .. they are not mammals. stop making up stupid fan lore about pixels. please
as much as agree that forcing simple headcanons is kind of dumb  i fund your title horribly offensive. i mean lgbtqrstuv123  homophobia at its finest. plus  claiming demisexual as normal and making multiple videos complaining about lgbtia representation in shows is gross.
everything is lgbtqaids these days.
gee...i thought it was lgbtqwtflol.
birdo is trans
as an progressive who has a brain  please stop labeling dumb political stunts and idea  woke   it s the opposite. woke means smart and self aware  this is not.
you will submit your straghtness and christianity and worship lbgtqara   as a superior race .
birdo  pink creature that spits out eggs from its mouth  is a transvestite according to nintendo. that s the only canon gay thing that s in the super mario bros. universe.
