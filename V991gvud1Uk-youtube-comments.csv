i was called out of the  church system  about 7 years ago.  it wasn t until i got away from all the noise did i start growing into a real knowledge and personal relationship with christ.
small home churches guided by the real holy spirit.......like in the old days.
narrow is the gate that leads to life  and there are few who will find it.  churches that preach the true gospel are shrinking because the culture wants its ears tickled. false churches that preach secular humanism  moral relativism  and an all-permissive culture are thriving. fans of christ are being separated from followers of christ. we were warned this would happen.
as a new mother  i feel this on a deep level. keep speaking the truth  sister!
my wife and i left the institutional church  organized religion  several years ago  with a number of other people. we formed a home bible study and home church and it is healthy and solid. it is a place where the full council of god is preached and studied. where prayer is at the forefront and the holy spirit leads and y shua messiah is most welcome!  and  nickels and noses  and  wokeness  are non-existent! 47 years in various forms of ministry and it feels like we have come full circle to a 1st century congregation! blessed!
churches as buildings can be packed to the gills with people and be totally bereft of actual christians.
as a catholic i am disgusted by the present leadership.  faithful catholics have to fight against not only our own pope but the fbi as well.
the church is asleep at the wheel. most pastors tell stories wanting a laugh and a check. they preach about getting along with coworkers  how to get your best life now and nothing about sin and prophecy.
i don t think we can imagine how crazy it is going to be... thanks patriot nurse
i agree with her 100 . western christianity is crumbling.
what a great analysis!  thanks  pn for all you do.  as a fellow christ-follower born-again christian  i loved the way you presented this subject!!  praise god.
one of the biggest problems in the church is people cherry picking scriptures they want to follow... and excluding those that prevent them from having  fun ... such as... no sex outside of marriage. god is not looking to play games... and neither should we. people say...  well  the world and society has changed ... my response... yes  but god has not changed. stand strong with god our heavenly father.
well said.   i used to be a church going man. however  the devotion to new carpet  fancy windows  latest sound system  etc separated me from the church. as another youtuber says  the sunday show. add to it  in every denomination  sexual immorality  and i would consider even worse  the great lengths to cover it up. the sin festers and the infection grows.    i stood face to face with an arch-bishop and refused to shake his hand  because  he  waited to the very last day to provide information  to law enforcement  the church had upon an employee who took sexual advantage of an adult women in a counseling session for serious marriage problems. the arch-bishop waited till 5 00pm  the last minute  to comply with a court order. what a scumbag. this is beyond catholic  baptist  methodist  etc. the corruption of the church is very serious.
this is why i m so thankful that revivals are breaking out everywhere! the church is waking up! the remnant is arising! god always had a remnant. even if it was only one. thank you jesus for your mercy  grace and awakening! thank you for your encouragement dear sister.
going solely on the title  i have to say the institutional church is dying but the body of christ is alive and well. many have fallen away  but those who remained are bring refined and filled with a new sense of purpose. i am hopeful  not for america  but to see god moving in the lives of the lost. now is the time to double down and go all in on christ  not to mourn what is passing away. there is no more time to play.
lately the lord has been whispering for me to get back to church. i left due to some hurtful people in church  but am hopeful to find a new church home.
we have just hired a new pastor. he and his family moved here to nc from texas. we are blessed to have them. it took about 2 years for the search committee to find him. our church is growing again and prayer works. thank you pn for the video.
i believe the pivot was madalyn murray o hair and engle v. vitale 1962  removing prayer from our schools.  david barton of wallbuilders has done an excellent job outlining the decline of america  post prayer removal.  thank you for an outstanding message at just the right time !
you are sadly very correct. things that were not condoned in society are now celebrated. i appreciate you. thanks
the reason that the church is dying in this country is because the church got soft.  this is evident in a numbers of things 1  male congregants as a percentage of the total congregation has been steadily declining for years.  in some churches  the male congregants consist almost entirely of either boys who are there with their parents or elderly men who have been attending for decades.  the young men  especially young  single men  in the congregation are nearly nonexistent.2  too many members of the clergy are getting caught in scandals of either a financial or sexual variety.  everytime that a pastor  priest  reverend or rabbi gets outed for something and a local scandal erupts  it undermines the entire institution of which that one congregation of believers is a part.3  too many churches these days seem to want to  play nice  with pop culture.  this leads to mixed messaging and eventually an intellectual trap where scripture takes a backseat to calls for kindness.  i m not for being mean to people but if the scripture is not held up as a standard  then something will have to take its place as a standard.  what will that be and how will it make sense within the context of a church  especially a church that has already decided to brush aside its own sacred text
same here! i believe god s seasons operate in 7 s
just curious during your time away from the church system did you have any type of corporate style of worship gathering of saints
@smoky mountain concealment  i wonder why you ask. do you feel that  corporate worship  is a necessary thing  if so  why
same!!
same here.  there are great internet pastors and other people of faith who stick to the bible. i can follow them at home.  jesus is with me every day performing miracles in my life.
@jeepster gal  because the new testament says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together.

@smoky mountain concealment   i hear that question alot when i tell someone that i was called out of the  church system . to answer your question... many of my relationships fell off when i moved to a new state. i was in a few ministries and the reality is that alot of guys get wrapped up into ministries for the wrong reasons. i had enough of the  beers and bibles  .... mens bible studies and seeing worship replaced with a  rock show . i ve only been a christian for 20 years so i have alot to learn. but its seems as if god works in seasons in my life and many of the lifes that i read about in the bible. i have turned my back on the idea of denominations... i think its evil to try to put god in a box. it blows my mind that any one man thinks he knows the full counsil of a supernatrual god. i have also moved away from the ties of legalism. i still talk and have fellowship with a handful of men. i m sure you know the scripture...  where two or three have gathered in my name.... there i am among them.   that seems to be where i am at for now... but who knows what god has for me tomorrow   for today... i just want to know him.... and thats enough.
you are correct. huge numbers of people are leaving the auditorium business and meeting in homes more and more.
home churches  were necessary in the early church because of horrible persecution. worship was even done in the catacombs.
amish have church in homes so nothing new.
exactly!
yep acts 2
as it was in the beginning  so it will be at the end.
my husband and i have our own church service. we are currently in matthew.
hebrews says we are to gather together  . so home small groups can be beneficial  but isolating yourself as a christian is unbiblical.  we are called  the body of christ.
like in red china
completely agree. the scriptures predicted it as part of end times.
very good
we are all sinners and have fallen short of the glory of god  heaven   we are born destined for hell.it is those who believe in christ and that he took on the burden of sin and paid for our sins at the cross. we are condemned from birth. it is not by works that you are saved  but by grace through faith in christ alone.not everybody in the world is automatically saved and are allowed to sin as they will because they believe christ paid for their sins. if you willingly persist in your sin and are unrepentant  you will go to hell.
as i have already mentioned    the church  or whatever you want to call it has always been on the wide   broad path.  it has never been on the narrow   set-a-part path!  it has always confused men s doctrine with the will of god.  it has been teaching confusion  babel  for almost 2 thousand years.  it is full of un-godly mixture!
the wheats and the tares will be separated.. notice how tares look similar to wheat  but they are not rhe real thing.
congratulations on the gift god has given you  that s amazing
@isaac  thanks!
homeschool don t send your precious kids to any gov or private schools
@robert john thomas  my two best friends are church-attending christians and even though we don t attend church services together  our discussions are about faith a lot.  yes  two or more gathered together.
when christ said he ll separate the sheep from the wolves it was directed at the church  the church  it s leaders and followers are the wolves and christ sheep who left the church  you know the one that are presently scattered  those are the sheep.
the cowardly and diabolical abandonment of exorcisms  spiritual warfare  deliverance and the godly holy spirit infilling has caused all the destructions in the world..past and present..god save us now..
circle of life for everything there is a time do justice  love mercy  walk humbly with god..  my people are destroyed for lack of  godly  knowledge and understanding   wisdom ... the whole world tries to block   steal your godliness.. test the spirits   people  and dont be decieved.. great   powerful prayerfulness is a christians birthright and obligation all that is wrong is based on ungodliness  foolishness  unprayerfulness and sin.. all christians are born into spiritual warfare and most dont know it or do it.... jeremiah 17 5- trust in god  not in human beings better to obey god than men  the just shall by mustard seed childlike fath.  the enemies will only find themselves fighting against god god is in control and not the evildoers   god always wins
@robert john thomas  yes...me too...but i left the  altars of god  for longer than you have been a  christian ...i agree that  putting god in a box  is sinful...the king james demonologist  bible  et all  is akin to  putting god in a box ...peace on firm not  flat   earth -the  apostle  john
@lanette scapillato  but how do you get sharpened   both challenged   encouraged  by other believers   if you ve withdrawn from the vineyard
@the hall family  by having a close relationship with jesus and holy spirit. do you think any person is going to encourage or correct you better than those two
@james h. maloy jr.  while paul s writings are full of wisdom  and should be listened to  they are not commandments.  if god calls you to do something for a season  your excuse for not doing it shouldn t be  well but paul said so .
@james h. maloy jr.  you re exactly correct. christ doesn t call you out of his church to forsake corporate gathering of the saints on the lord s day. christ doesn t call you into sin. sounds like these folks just need a more solid church  not to forsake it all together. it s interesting that mathew 18 was quoted here referring to where two or three are gathered christ will be with them. the context there is christ being with them for the purpose of church discipline.
@lanette scapillato  what about baptism  communion  etc.  do you still have those
@chatsworth osborne  jr.  where did jesus say that
@j.p. saverance  he didnt. that s the problem with these sectarian minimalists.
@jody webb  i understand clearly what the standard of truth   god says   requires  is . i do believe your personal   message is rather masqueraded in misguided understanding  with a lot of cherry picking conveniences that help a  wounded or fatigued soul  feel more validated as a result of  particular  temptations often so very subtly disquisition as compromises.scripture also declares that we are not promised   ease or comfort  in this life if we are to endure the race of faith till the end  in order to be able to stand in confidence   receive the honor in the words spoken to us @ the end of our assigned life-race    well done good   faithful servant
@the hall family  i suppose you are welcome to feel how you like about my personal  message  since in the end you are ultimately accountable only to god  as am i. however  you are completely wrong in how you are interpreting me which you are also accountable for  so there is that.
@jody webb  this is the issue with you not being part of s solid church... you saying paul doesn t give commands of god is very troubling. you  and every other christian are commanded by god to gather in the sense of a new testament church. it s that simple. hebrews 10 25 for example is explicit and didactic.
@jody webb  i do believe   know that   those two    holy spirit   jesus  function through others   others being other believers .  hence the need    purpose for being   sharpened  as iron sharpens iron  for strengthening. reinforcing  and enduring the   heat  of life . bc the apostle paul promises as does the disciple matthew  that we as believers will experience   heat  in this life. it s not a matter of if but definitely a reality of when. ever observe the process of iron being forged in a fiery furnace        a process known   understood to be   blacksmithing .  it s a fascinating process to behold and understand how the process serves the purpose.
@jackgtx440   can you tell me where i can find a  more solid church   i honestly don t see it. i hope i am wrong.. but i think we are in the days that 2 timothy 3 spoke about...
@eman  you just contradicted yourself. you said that faith in christ alone saves but that if you persist in your sins you will go to hell. you are ultimately preaching a works based gospel like the catholics.for by grace are ye saved through faith  and that not of yourselves  it is the gift of god  not of works  lest any man should boast.   eph 2 8-9 .christ did pay for your sins. faith in him having washed your sins away is all you need for salvation  even if you keep sinning which i guarantee you will  willingly or not. i m not saying that sinning is good  just that you cannot stop sinning until the day you die.
@the plasma collider  if you persist in your sins  you are not saved and you do not believe in christ. you may say the words  but they are lies.you may not do as you please because you think you are saved no matter what you do.i ll say it again  if you persist in your sins  then you deny the power of god.2 timothy 2-5 2for people will be lovers of self  lovers of money  proud  arrogant  abusive  disobedient to their parents  ungrateful  unholy  3heartless  unappeasable  slanderous  without self-control  brutal  not loving good  4treacherous  reckless  swollen with conceit  lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god  5having the appearance of godliness  but denying its power. avoid such people.
@the plasma collider  so no  i did not contradict myself
@eman  what you are saying is heresy and unbiblical. ultimately you are preaching a works based salvation. you are not justified by not persisting in your sins. you sin every day whether you want to or not. you are justified by faith in christ to wash away your sins.therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight  for by the law is the knowledge of sin. but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested  being witnessed by the law and the prophets  even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe  for there is no difference  for all have sinned  and come short of the glory of god  being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus   romans 3 20-24 i am not saying that sinning is ok. it is not and god will chastise and punish you for that. but you will not lose your salvation which is essentially what you are saying. and i give unto them eternal life  and they shall never perish  neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. my father  which gave them me  is greater than all  and no man is able to pluck them out of my father s hand. i and my father are one.  john 10 28-30 in whom ye also trusted  after that ye heard the word of truth  the gospel of your salvation  in whom also after that ye believed  ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise   eph 1 13 now if you are talking about someone who says he s a christian but is really not  and his persistent sinning is evidence of this  that s different. but striving everyday not to sin  repenting every day of sinning in order to obtain salvation  this does not get salvation but is works based heresy. the desire to strive every day not to sin comes as a result of salvation not as a requirement for it.
@the plasma collider   but you will not lose your salvation which is essentially what you re saying i never said you can lose your salvation. you re putting words in my mouth. don t do that.unrepentant sin is evidence of not being saved.
@the plasma collider  again  let me be absolutely clear  if you persist in your sin you will go to hell.if you claim to know jesus  and you are even baptized in water  but you enjoy causing strife  doing pranks  street theater  slandering people  whether you feel justified doing it or not  you will go to hell.
@the plasma collider  matthew 7 21 23 not everyone who says to me   lord  lord   will enter the kingdom of heaven  but the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven. 22 on that day many will say to me   lord  lord  did we not prophesy in your name  and cast out demons in your name  and do many mighty works in your name   23 and then will i declare to them   i never knew you  depart from me  you workers of lawlessness.
@eman  is there ever a day that you don t sin  if you sin every day then are you not persisting in your sins  if you have to repent daily  you are doing the works of the law and you will fail and go to hell. knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law  but by the faith of jesus christ  even we have believed in jesus christ  that we might be justified by the faith of christ  and not by the works of the law  for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.   galatians 2 16
@eman  i m not putting words in your mouth. losing your salvation is the inevitable conclusion of  not persisting  in your sins. to not persist in your sins  you must put in effort. you sin every day whether it be an unclean thought  a bad word  a lustful glance. if you have to repent every day  that is an action. faith in christ is a belief not an action.
@eman  ever learning  and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  2 tim 3 7  this chapter and the verses you re quoting are talking about the unsaved during the end times.  if you are trying not to sin for salvation from hell  you are doing work and relying on your own efforts. this will lead you to hell. if you have to try not to sin to be saved  you can lose your salvation. that is the logical conclusion.
@eman  people who believeth on christ are doing the will of the father and will go to heaven. prophesying in jesus s name and casting out demons is not the will of the father in this context. that is why jesus said  i never knew you  because they were not doing the will of the father even though they thought they were. for i came down from heaven  not to do mine own will  but the will of him that sent me. and this is the father s will which hath sent me  that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing  but should raise it up again at the last day. and this is the will of him that sent me  that every one which seeth the son  and believeth on him  may have everlasting life  and i will raise him up at the last day.   john 6  38-40
@the plasma collider  if you persist in your sins  you never were saved.that s what i m saying
@eman  then you who persists in your sins in one form or another were never saved if that is true. where is the point where you are no longer persisting in your sins  how do you measure it  don t you have impure  spiteful  jealous thoughts  if you commit a sin every other day  once a week or on and off  aren t you persisting in your sins albeit at a slower rate  what is the max rate or threshold of not persisting in your sins that  if you are under  god considers you not persisting in your sins and therefore  you are saved   if you commit one sin on one day and another on the other  are these two separate isolated sinning events or are they a mix and matched sinning event  don t get me wrong  i m not saying that sinning or  persisting  in sin is a good thing. it s bad  so bad that god sent his son jesus to die so that we might live. for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish  disobedient  deceived  serving divers lusts and pleasures  living in malice and envy  hateful  and hating one another. but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared  not by works of righteousness which we have done  but according to his mercy he saved us  by the washing of regeneration  and renewing of the holy ghost  which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour  that being justified by his grace  we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.   titus 3 3-7
@the plasma collider  i ve already made my point clear
amen brother amen

i agree  i left the organized church 5 or 6 years ago  i found no place for myself there  but my faith is stronger than ever.
most excellent! i love the idea of 1st century worship  getting back to the basics of the scriptures and truly letting the holy spirit lead his church in this age. blessings
god bless you and your group.  smiles.
me too as well. but it s hard to find other sabbath keepers -torah observant.so you become an island until the gathering of the yearly feast for the most part.
...it feels like we ve come full circle...it feels like... you know who else is all about the feels  and the answer  satan. satan rejected jesus which also means that satan rejected the way the truth and the life. if satan rejected the truth  then what does he have left  nothing  he has nothing left except the feels.
@kotik1033   which   organised church   did you leave
i left organized religion back in high school. i was good enough to babysit their kids on friday and saturday nights but wasn t good enough to say hi to on sunday morning. i never felt welcomed. i have been just fine with it being god  jesus and me going thru life together.
@matthew velazquez  i do not understand your reply   are you saying i am wrong to leave a church with abusive people running it   or are you saying it is okay that i save my heart and mind  not be a punching bag  and teach my child at home   please explain.
have you discovered the lie about sunday worship  the true sabbath was changed by rome-the little horn power of daniel 7  the papacy.  god said to labor for six days but the sabbath of the lord is the 7th day saturday  it was established in genesis 2 from the foundation of the world. the saints will keep the sabbath on the earth made new again as isaiah 66 states.
@debra collins  yes  i know.
@rita maid   elim pentecostal  but have also been in baptist and free evangelical
praise god !!! you have done beautiful works in his sight!!!
@doug darby  thank you!
way to go!
i feel we are going towards home church as a nation. if economy falls the church will not be able to afford the buildings etc. after covid hit  hubby lost his job  got a new one on weekends  so that cut out sundays. at the same time we started attending a small bible study at a local restaurant. it s wonderful!!
@debra collins  i m sorry but you are false in what you re saying about sunday. you ve been fed a bill of goods. that is not where sunday worship came from at all. and before you get the wrong idea  i assure you i m more protestant than anyone in this comment section.
@matthew velazquez satan rejected yeshua and created jesus to replace yeshua.
no kidding. i was heartened when i heard that my son and daughter in law regularly attend.  until i went to a program.  two women pastors. helping to celebrate   inclusion  with scarfs draped around their shoulders of a certain multi-colored hues. smh.. i m not for hating people  but how much do you love someone if you indulge them in their sin
@spot the borg cat  yep! i know of a church that has the same kind of  pastors . this is an old order church- one that you would never think to find it there!! why is this being allowed  i asked  because the elders  and many in the pews have said   well i can t say anything  my so-and so lives like that.
going to church doesn t make you a christian any more than going to a garage makes you a car.  -- billy sunday
absolutely
@kal burgy
sad!
under direct pressure  many more will fall away. their money  position  stuff  comforts of conformity to this  morally degraded society will be more important.
been to any school board meetings lately !
i understand and your right  from one catholic to another!
call no one  father  because there is no other. to call the pope  holy father is wrong.
@bman  exactly  but they do just that and think they ll be spared from hell. catholicism is paganism and has nothing to do with yah. then folks sit around wondering why the country is crumbling  while most people worship everything and everyone but the elohim of abraham  issac and jacob.
can you tell me how someone gets saved
@andrew slagle  what does being a catholic mean though  does it mean you re going to heaven
@andrew slagle    you re
@eman   it means you re catholic
@rita maid   what do catholics believe
do they even preach the gospel anymore  the gospel isn t the entire bible. the gospel simply means  good news .the gospel is the following  you are saved by grace through faith in christ and the works he did on the cross - paying for our sins so we don t have to - and not of works so that no one can boast of their salvation.
you are exactly right. thank you for your comment  i have not heard from you since the prepping preacher.
@angela hickman  wow... i m shocked someone would remember something like that.
they want a cheque   they don t want a check  they don t want to be checked.
@eman  - most teach the good news  but not why it s the good news.people need to be educated on the background info on why these things are important   how they go all the way back throughout jewish history   to the beginning itself in order to give people the meat   not just the hippie love candy aspect of it.
the physical church is only a building  and nothing more. being a christian is something that comes from the heart and the soul. saying that you are a christian means nothing if you don t live your life according to his words. we were warned that there would be false teachers and leaders  and we are definitely seeing that more and more.
for most church is a club like chess  tennis ect.. it s not about god at all... i have a customer who goes almost daily. yet i have never heard her talk about god at all. it s about the  church .
@an ford  i ve heard it compared to a country club. and i have been to a church like that.
@spot the borg cat  these are the one spoken of as jesus telling them that he never knew them they are workers of lawlessness
reading the word getting baptized and having jesus possess us is how we re saved. the word says call no man your father only the father in heaven!
sadder still  churches can be packed with very sincere believers that are being misled by greedy  prosperity  preachers.
@eman  you accept jesus as your savior. thru jesus we are saved. admit you are a sinner and need jesus in your heart and life. i am a sinner. i gave my life to jesus many years ago. i am constantly asking for help and guidance in my life and the world.
@eman   stop pretending that you don t know
@rita maid   do you know
@ooohhitskaren 63  do you know why we need a savior
@eman   of course   but you re desperate to tell me how pagan i am
jesus says    if you love me  keep my commandments.   john 3 16-17 pretty much says it all in a nutshell about being saved. actually....the whole book of john leaves no one in doubt. no one can enter the kingdom of god but by water and the spirit. be willing to give up all of this world  take up your cross and follow him!
@rita maid   what do you mean
@eman  read john 3.16 and believe on the word made flesh
@eman   you know fine well
@debra collins  being born of water means physical birth.the thief on the cross was saved the moment he believed in christ as he was already hanging on the cross
@eman  god gave us his only son jesus so thru jesus we are able to have everlasting life. thru jesus our sins are forgiven.
i was a catholic until i became reasonable....
@eman  if youbactually want to know read the nicean creed. if you want to know more read the catechism of trent.
@bman  when jesus said to  call no man your father on earth  for you have one father  who is in heaven   he is using an expression that has deep roots in the hebrew scriptures. to  call  someone by a  name  in the hebrew tradition meant something closer to  identifying the essence  of a person. for example  when the prophet isaiah says of the messiah that  his name will be called wonderful counselor  the mighty god  everlasting father  prince of peace   he certainly does not mean that those titles will be commonly used as names of the messiah by his contemporaries. none of jesus  contemporaries  not even the apostles themselves  called him those things. rather  the  name  here means the essence  and isaiah is describing the nature of the messiah  who will be  in his very nature  the  mighty god  who shares the essence of the  wonderful counselor   the holy spirit  and the  everlasting father   god the father .  so  in this hebrew tradition  when jesus says   call no one on earth your father   he means   recognize no one on earth as your father in his essence for by nature and by essence  there is only one father  that is  god the father.  in a very real sense  all other fathers  even one s own biological father  are imitation fathers  because god is the true father who begets children in a way that only he  as god  can. when you were conceived  god created your soul de novo   new   and ex nihilo   from nothing.  that is true fatherhood! your biological father did not create anything de novo or ex nihilo. your biological father contributed to your body in a physical process that was wondrously fashioned by god  but nonetheless completely natural and according to physical laws. in a very real sense  your physical father is only a father by analogy  that is  human fatherhood is similar to true fatherhood  which god alone exercises. another way to look at it is that we can call our biological fathers  father  only because god is our true father. all paternity is an imitation of the paternity of god the father  as st. paul says   i bow my knees before the father  from whom all fatherhood  greek patria  in heaven and on earth is named   eph 3 14 15  my translation .
@eman  his commandment is not be born of water and again of spirit  it is to be born again of water and spirit. john gave the example  jesus confirmed it at the jordan after his 40 day fast  to begin his public ministry. reject it at your own peril.
@old bay  we ll miss you. bye bye
catholic here.  i agree.
agreed  i m also catholic and protecting our church from  our own pope  is rediculous! the devil slithered his way into the foundation of the church in vatican ii .
@andrew slagle   with me  3 catholics.
@mike s  the thief on the cross never had water baptism and he was saved because he was baptized in the spirit. being born of water means being born in the flesh  natural birth
@mike s  water baptism isn t necessary for salvation. there are many people who are baptized by water and are not going to heaven.your righteousness is as filthy rags to the lord
@anthony tripp right here with you  in my disgust.  yet  we must remain faithful to christ.  pope bxvi said the church will become smaller.  we see the signs of apostasy  again  coming out of germany. the enthronement of the  amazonian demon idol which was then cast into the tiber.  our lady s immaculate heart will triumph in he end when she crushes the head of satan.   jmj
as a protestant i stand with my catholic friends in your fight for the right to practice free speech and religion.sic semper tyrannis.
@bman  i see it as an abomination.
and fight against the bad clergy as well.  still so many attempts to guilt trip.
@marlin avila  amen! smaller but faithful
@eman  if a person will accept jesus christ of nazareth. ask jesus to forgive them of all their sins   that person becomes a child of the most high god and his kingdom. john 3 16 for god so loved the world  that he gave his only begotten son  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish  but have everlasting life. romans 10 9 -10 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus  and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead  thou shalt be saved.  for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness  and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. acts 2 21 and it shall come to pass  that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved.   a person must believe jesus christ is the son of god and came to save all that will confess him as lord and savior. after that jesus tells us to follow him and his ways. john 14 6 jesus saith unto him  i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me. this is the only way to be saved through jesus christ of nazareth.
eh  don t worry about it. the roman leadership has never been that great.  i like having the right to read the bible pray in my own language
the bible says to come out of her.revelation 18 4and i heard another voice from heaven  saying  come out of her  my people  that ye be not partakers of her sins  and that ye receive not of her plagues.  authorized king james bible
@arliss young  the only thing the thief on the cross did was believe in christ
@eman  catholic means universal  we show reverence to the mary and the saints but only jesus is worshiped as god
@eman  confession and baptism
@bman  they re earthly fathers  you have a dad don t you
@m   the gates of hell shall not prevail against us    it s impossible for the devil to take over the church.
fbi  you mean gestapo
amen. glad to know i m not alone in my thinking.  jesus told peter the gates of hell would not prevail  in that i find my peace. all we can do is keep our eyes on him and and do our best to look upon everyone like we hope to do in heaven. that helps me to remember his command to pray for them as well. god s blessings on you and yours. jmj
@thecountrycrusader  the church in the scripture is not what the catholic religion calls  the church . the church in scripture is the body of believers  who have been made part of the body of christ by accepting jesus christ alone  god in the flesh   as their savior  and are sealed with the holy spirit unto the day of redemption.
@eman  read john 3 1ff
@mike s  if you want to know gods ways read the bible!
@thecountrycrusader  impossible to prevail  but hes definately inside it. but he wont win
how do you fight back
catholicism is a false and fatal gospel. the mass  eucharist  purgatory  confession  mary worship  etc. are all blasphemous  heretical  and unbiblical.
@eman  yes  the thief knew jesus was the son of god  he did nothing wrong but was being put to death and the thief knew that he asked jesus to remember him and jesus knew the thief s  heart.
@formermpsgt  cover to cover friend.
@eman  repent of your sins. accept yeshua as lord and savior and be baptized. ask the holy spirit to come into your heart and make you new.
@thecountrycrusader  why do some pray to mary  jesus made it very clear that no one can cross from here to there. mary was blessed to have jesus but that s the end of it. she passed and has no seat in the kingdom of god of any kind. she can not do anything in or of the kingdom of god. the only one that can forgive sins is jesus. no one comes to the father but through him. why would anyone waist time confessing sins to a man  pop . that man is nothing but a man  he has no power of any kind to forgive sins. again only jesus. do catholics read the word of god the bible  how can anyone study god s word and follow a man  god made it very clear not to make any graven images of any kind and the catholic church is full of them  a image of mary would be just what god told us not to do. i ask because i don t know or understand how people can be lead away with the things that are clearly against god s rules. no one on this earth is given power to change god s word for any reason. god made that very clear.
@scott dunn  and how do you come to this
@anthony tripp  leave that churchfor a better one.
@silvernblack21  anglicans use the word father as well for their leader.
@m  i didn t  come up with this ... martin luther and the reformers did a couple of years ago... may i suggest some videos by mike gendron  and many others who will show you the false teachings of the catholic church.
@thecountrycrusader  faith alone in christ alone.
@otium serenitatem  faith alone in christ alone.the thief on the cross was not baptized  yet he was saved
find a traditional orthodox church near you  as they still hold to the true church  and have since it was founded.
@eman  first believe that jesus is the son of god and that he came and died on the cross for our sins. repent and turn from your sin. then be baptized for the remission or washing away from sin. you must be born again through water  not sprinkling of water but emerged in water so that you will receive the holy spirit. read act chapter 2. i am praying for you.
@eman  he that calleth on the name of the lord shall be saved! romans 10 9  kjv   that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus  and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead  thou shalt be saved. rom.10 13. also   mark 16 16  kjv   he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved  but he that believeth not shall be damned.   john 10 9  kjv   i am the door  by me if any man enter in  he shall be saved  and shall go in and out  and find pasture. acts 2 21  kjv   and it shall come to pass  that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved.
i agree no priest and no sister is higher then jesus  i m sick of these denominations even catholicism gate keeping to putting those in the church on pedestals.
@el super pollo  they are just people  no better or worse than any other  as a whole  the bad chose an evil path and like any evil folks  they will get what they deserve.
@old bay  same here. freedom in jesus and being able to study the bible for myself was a true blessing.
anthony  i am catholic here also and i agree.
as a fellow catholic  i couldn t agree with you more.
@thecountrycrusader  hou bow down to idols and pray to the dead demons!
@ashton roberts  revelations 3.5 they that overcome i will not blot their name out of the book of life! there is no calvinistic satanic eternal security! you can loose your salvation by sin! name blotted out means it was there and now it is not!
@formermpsgt  please show me what  i said that was unscriptural.
@formermpsgt   and grieve not the holy spirit of god  whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.     in whom ye also trusted  after that ye heard the word of truth  the gospel of your salvation  in whom also after that ye believed  ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise    12  for as the body is one  and hath many members  and all the members of that one body  being many  are one body  so also is christ.  13  for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body  whether we be jews or gentiles  whether we be bond or free  and have been all made to drink into one spirit.   and if by grace  then is it no more of works  otherwise grace is no more grace. but if it be of works  then is it no more grace  otherwise work is no more work.
@ronda unsensored hayes  you are not saved by water baptism. water baptism is not scriptural. the thief on the cross was not baptized yet he was saved
amen brother.
@arliss young  i don t think most catholics actually know the bible. i will bring up verses in discussion and ask them to provide verses for their opposing belief.  they never can give me any.
@formermpsgt  then that makes you the author and finisher of your faith. not god. read hebrews 12 2. i would also suggest ephesians 2  8-9  for by grace are you saved through faith. it is not of yourselves lest anyone boast. the bible cannot be more clear on this.
@amy woodson  i have never gotten to talk to any about the bible. i know some of things are far away from the word of god. i am guessing they only go by what is given to them as  truth  and live by it. it s truly sad to see people this mislead.
@arliss young  that is common in cults.
@amy woodson  very true. i see people being lead astray every day. i guess it s easer for them to let other people to think for them and instill their views.
@eman  go study john chapter 6 and answer how you have eaten the flesh of christ. otherwise stop harassing the catholics with your infantile understanding of christianity.
@amy woodson  this is true.  fr. mike schmitz has a  bible in a year  which is catholic centered - meaning it includes the deuterocanonical texts.  changed my life seeing the bible in context.  it actually reveals alot of stuff the protestants shy away from in the bible such as john 6 with the  eat my flesh  monologue  as well as the new ark of the covenant in revelation.
@mathurm100    answer how you have eaten the flash of christ  are you asking a question
@mathurm100  say more. you re not teaching anybody anything.all you re doing right now is acting like you have an argument  but you don t.
@eman  transubstsntiation is a thing - the bread and wine literally become thebody and blood of christ in the catholic mass
@eman  now you explain how you have eaten the flesh of christ
@mathurm100  all you said was  john 6 . give me the verse and quit being lazy.like john 19 30
@eman  too lazy to go read a chapter in your bible  6 56 but read the rest around it. people got freaked out because it sounded like cannibalism and he did not correct them. because he meant what he said.  jesus does not lie.
@mathurm100  that is what was called a  hard saying  because the disciples missed his point. jesus came to bring and sustain spiritual life  yet they were still thinking of physical life. just like you are.john 6 60you need to to pray for discernment when reading the word
@eman  he says it like 3-4 times and when called out on it for being a difficult thing to hear he doubled down on it.    if you need discernment to understand this you re really saying that you need some way to explain away the difficult nature of the concept.so i will ask again - how have you eaten the flesh of christ and drank his blood
@mathurm100  what do you mean  how have you eaten the flesh of christ and drank his blood   i m not even trying to be difficult or play games with you. you brought up the eucharist  not me. reword your question or give more context. your question makes no sense to me.i get the sense that you re trying to win an argument by coming off as a irrational or erratic as possible.use better grammar and don t neglect punctuation marks.
all who believe in yeshua are in this category not just catholics
what does john 4 23 mean and why is there no denomination listed
matthew 23  8-10 call no man your father! but yhwh the almighty! psalms 83 18
@eman   read the 2nd chapter of acts. it is the first sermon peter presented after christ arose to prepare a place for us.
as the writer of the original post that started this thread  i am disappointed that so many so-called christians are using this as an opportunity to bash catholicism.  if you are happy in your protestant faith  then that s fine  but bashing another person s religion  whether catholic or jewish or moslem  is just showing intolerance and is disrespectful of other people s rights
@anthony tripp  i have bashed no one! i have simply quoted the word  if we are believers in yeshua then we accept his word the bible   all of it! i love all of yhwh the father s children. i simply quoted matthew 7 23 and john 4 23 which expresses no denomination! so no i am no protestant....god bless you
@eman  christ said whomever eats his flesh and drinks his blood will have eternal life. if you don t do that you won t have eternal life. so if you haven t eaten his flesh or drank his blood you re wasting your time.   so how have you accomplished this task   it s a simple question. you either believe transubstantiation is a thing and the mass is a perpetual sacrifice and the lamb is consumed in a most literal sense. or you have a different interpretation of what it means  but either way. you must consume the flesh of christ to have eternal life.
i agree.i miss john paul so much.the devil is at work in the hearts of way too many clergy across all christian groups. pray for all holy leaders of all types or paths  not sure how to phrase  it perfectly  to have the holy ghost push all evil from their heart  soul   minds.
@mathurm100  you re talking about a works based salvation. we are saved by grace through faith and not of works.
@mathurm100  1 corinthians 15 1-4 now i would remind you  brothers  a  of the gospel i preached to you  which you received  in which you stand  2 and by which you are being saved  if you hold fast to the word i preached to you unless you believed in vain.3 for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received  that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures  4 that he was buried  that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures
@mathurm100  and what do you mean  people got freaked out because it sounded like cannibalism  to what verse are you referring when they  freaked out
@silvernblack21  the catholic church is the one true church established by jesus. you should repent. also  call no man father  is the lowest iq attempt to attack catholicism and has been addressed countless times over the last 2k years. i encourage you to study the early church  and the writings of the early church fathers  and to seek info on the catholic church from primary sources rather than from heretical cults.
@bman  the catholic church is the one true church established by jesus. you should repent. also  call no man father  is the lowest iq attempt to attack catholicism and has been addressed countless times over the last 2k years. i encourage you to study the early church  and the writings of the early church fathers  and to seek info on the catholic church from primary sources rather than from heretical cults.
@eman  verse 61  62  67  people were like  uh wut   and many quit following him.  he didn t clarify and say something like  wait i mean figuratively and will later give you bread to pretend that it s my body  he doubled down.  does this offend you    you have to go outside of the bible to history to see the cannibal thing. the romans spread that one
@bman  he the pope is the vicar of christ. your a protestant and are obviously not aware of the history and meaning.
@bman  jesus called abraham  father. better read your bible. try looking up father in your concordance.
@eman  read the creed. the apostles creed. given to us by the apostles thru the holy spirit. the catholic church believes in the revealed truth of holy scriptures and holy tradition. the holy tradition revealed to us by god. st. paul wrote about it.
@john grimm  galatians 2 16 yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in jesus christ  so we also have believed in christ jesus  in order to be justified by faith in christ and not by works of the law  because by works of the law no one will be justified
@john grimm  john 3 16 for god so loved the world  that he gave his only son  that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
@john grimm  romans 4 4-8 now to the one who works  his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. 5 and to the one who does not work but believes in a  him who justifies the ungodly  his faith is counted as righteousness  6 just as david also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom god counts righteousness apart from works 7  blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven     and whose sins are covered 8 blessed is the man against whom the lord will not count his sin.
@john grimm  the holy scripture is from genesis to revelation. end
@m aytt  thank you  i may look into that
@thecountrycrusader  praying to mary is blasphemy
@eman  no it s simply a religious label or  branding  of a particular belief system. think of it as being a particular label of a belief system. the label   doesn t   save  or   protect  anyone from revelation style wrath. the label     might   make the person feel better about things or feel more superior to others but it doesn t bring about actually any spiritual maturity or development or growth. bc to experience those things comes from skid accurate health scriptural teaching. and if centuries worth of generations   from generation to generation are consistently taught or instructed incorrectly  how are they to know to or become aware of any difference or discrepancies in accuracy if all the are ever taught is inaccurate    just someone things to process   think about.
@eman  whosoever will!
@eman  eating the body and blood is partaking in christ s sufferings. it s not some man magically converting earthly things into god. duh!!!
catholicism was founded by jesus christ. catholic in latin means  universal . so the catholic church means the  universal church . god wanted to extend salvation for everyone  not just the jews. unfortunately  the jews never accepted jesus as the messiah. moses made miracles through god  but jesus christ was able to do miracles on his own. but jesus christ did miracles that no one had done before  and that was bringing people back to life from the dead. jesus christ was able to do this because jesus christ is god himself in human form. people criticize catholics for worshiping saints by building statues of them  but catholics don t worship saints. this is like when they take your photo in high school and display it to show the graduating class of that year. that doesn t mean you are being worshipped ! you are just being acknowledged. same with the saints  their paintings or statues are there to remind us of the great things god has done through them. people also mention that catholics are cannibals  which is completely false. cannibalism is depicted as eating your own kind. jesus christ had a human form  but technically he is god  so eating the flesh of god can t be called cannibalism. the thief that died on the cross was saved because before his death  he humbled himself  repented and acknowledged that jesus christ was the son of god. a lot of people die suddenly  without having the opportunity to repent. so don t be unprepared  you have to be on god s good side all the time  even when we sin  we have to try and make things right. in order to partake in the eucharist  you have to be free of sin by confession. so that s why jesus christ says that you have to eat his flesh and drink his blood in order to be saved. so when you are free of sin   you are able to participate in communion. in the ten commanments  it says you have to love your neighbor. one of the best ways to love your neighbor is by giving him service helping. that s why jesus christ cleaned the apostles feet  to show them how he loved them and how the apostles should humble themselves and love their neighbors. this means helping your neighbors  beggars  etc. i know it s annoying for a lot of people  but i m sure at one point in our lives we have been helped by the most uncommon person and i m sure we were all very glad they did. we need to not only return the favor  but we need more people like that. sometimes we need to step up and be the ones to do it first. for people that are luke warm in their faith  there are hundreds of miracles  relics and stories people tell in articles  t tok  sap chat  etc. as for the pope  don t blame leadership solely on the pope  he is human  he is not a perfect being. remember the apostles were with jesus christ himself and they still fell asleep  judas betrade  etc. some people are just lazy  luke warm  and blame their reasons for not going to church on the priest or something else.
@eddienanakase  romans started catholic religion with all it s pagan doctrines.
@scott dunn   stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught  either by word of mouth or by letter of ours . 2 thessalonians 2 15 . there were oral traditions as well as the written word.  the scriptures of the new testament were used as proof that christ fulfilled the predictions of the profits of the old testament.  that he overcame death to save us.  they had to convert the  pagans  which meant  everyone else in the world who weren t jewish . the jews had their own traditions lots of them.  all religions had  traditions .  one tradition of the jews was to revere honor the king s mother.  she was honored alongside the king.  through mary s intervention  the first miracle jesus performed of changing water to wine.  why would she only be cast aside as just a vessel for giving birth   might as well call her  the birthing person .  can you ask your grandma to pray with you if she was   saved   isn t she in heaven   that s the idea of asking the saints for help mary is the most exalted saint the mother of god  mary please pray for us! please please pray for me and with me
the fbi
@john schunk   @john schunk  i don t want to get into the technicalities  but what s more important is what it does for you as a person. most people attribute the nostic writings as being part of the bible  but they can t be  not even their messages teach simular messages found in the bible. nostic writings sound more similar to the zodiac. i m mentioning the nostic writings because i feel that s the only pagan things that people are trying to attach to the catholic faith. most of the people that tell me that the catholic church is pagan and that it s not special  is people that are luke warm lazy to the point that they don t want to feel guilty for their bad behavior. if the catholic church was pagan  why has it been blessed so much by god  ! if the catholic church is so bad  why is it the most persecuted religion !  i hope you never find yourself in a situation where you know your life is hanging by a thread and you have nowhere to go but to ask god for help. well  that would actually be a good thing. you might be young  but wait until you get older and realize that living life in the mental life style parameters of an animal is pointless. don t ever forget this  a lot of people at the end of their lives  feel like there s something empty  something that is missing. that happens even with the fulfillment of having kids. at some point  you are going to question life. that emptiness is the absence of god ! john  i hope you at least come across someone amazing in your lifetime  someone that does the work of god. that person is going to challenge your logic and perception of life  take care  god bless !
@thecountrycrusader  as a child certain things disturbed me as a catholic.  praying to anyone else other than god  is sin.  not mary  or any of the  saints.   the bible refers to believers as saints.  all true believers are saints.  so we are not to pray to dead humans.  confession as well is problematic  the bible says  there is one mediator between god and man  christ jesus.   also  when people say they do not worship mary or the other statues  but they genuflect and make the sign of the cross in front of the statue  that is indeed worship.  all honor and glory is for the lord.  the teaching that the pope is infallible.  can we honestly say that the things this pope says are infallible   many of them are directly opposed to scripture.  that also goes for all the popes in the past  they are humans and sin.  this also goes for preachers and pastors who have been going against what is clear in scripture  just to go along to get along.  the  bible warns about such teachers.  this is why people are leaving not only the catholic church  but many others as well.
@formermpsgt  jesus wrote a believers name in the book of life in his precious blood... not in disappearing ink. you cannot lose your salvation. period.
@eddienanakase  thank you
you only have to look at the emmy s and the 2022 birmingham commonwealth games. go look those two events up and compare that to your comment.
satan never stops working. there will come a day when he won t have a job.
@z4 dude  i m looking forward to that day.
it s demise started with politicization.
as predicted in the bible.   the falling away of christians paves the way for the antichrist and the judgement of god.
thank you for being so honest and taking a stand when you saw what was happening.  i ve seen the very same   gone through it myself. too many woman   children have   are being abused and taken advantage of.
amen!! the best is yet to come!!!!
good will always defeat evil. however  it couldnt hurt to help it along.
the body lives within us.
agreed. i m praying fervently for genuine revival among the church. not necessarily to the end that the us be restored to its former glory i believe that ship has sailed but that more of the lost can be enlightened to the gospel of our savior  yashua hamashiach. our only hope rests in him. and if we are living our lives for his kingdom  we don t need the world  or anything it has to offer.
i agree. our church is more packed than ever and our sunday school room is at capacity. something has changed though. when our pastor said there are only 2 genders a few families got up and left  but those still there are growing deeper in their faith and forming closer connections with each other too.
hm they must be in hiding.
the problem is finding others who believe in truth
mark 13 23  kjv 23 but take ye heed  behold  i have foretold you all things.
amen
@deepwaters333  if you are born again  the holy spirit lives within you. the body of christ make up his bride. the father  the son and the holy ghost is the god head.
god s church will always stand until he comes for them.
well said.
@tonya perry  thank you tonya and god bless you.  smiles  this all was very painful.
best comment
@deepwaters333  you are welcome. if you are born again  nothing to worry about. we will be called up raptured out to meet him in the air.if you are not born again  i pray you will seek him. the lord  jesus christ will come you and save you.
@sheepdog 45  this is where i m at!  i m a canadian and sometimes i think american christians think god needs the us to be powerful in order to fulfill his words.  maybe the opposite is true.  the us and all of the western nations need to be brought to their knees!  then perhaps the revival that we long for will sweep us out of our slumber!
@tanya bailey  then that medsage was clearly not for them. they are still loved by chrisr. they just dont know that.
@tonya perry  i have a very strong and close relationship with jesus and the creator.
you all keep believing and praying. the rest of us will figure out a way to stop this.
@thecohorts  believing and praying is the way to stop it
amen
@tanya bailey  your church  do you mean your congregation   do you believe that salvation comes through an institutionalized group  or through a relationship with the god of abraham  isaac  and jacob
@thecohorts  good luck
...amen!...
@scott farraway   i m in the us and i value my freedom  but realize that it merely makes my faith easy to hold to.  the wealth and power of the us are not a treasure to me.  sadly  i think it is the freedom that we will lose.
truth in the way.
amen @olddannyboy12 one thing we must understand as followers of yeshua  we will suffer for our faith and possibly be killed for it  see in rev the beast goes after those who keep the commandments and have the testimony of yeshua messiah. after 26 yrs in the church here on the west coast  a so called bible teaching church  line by line....with commentary of what it said i left the building 11 years ago. i haven t lost my faith.... only thing i lost was the false teaching of scripture  like pagan christmas  easter  the pre trib rapture doctrine  the assumption that yeshua did away with the law and was nailed to the cross  the feasts are just for jews  also the sabbath was changed to sun day.  i learned all these truths when i left the brainwashing.  sad i was saved in this church at 35 yrs old.... i didn t know anything else.  then the holy spirit woke me up  i had to leave. i believe the only thing worth spending time on now is sharing the gospel  not becoming a super patriot for a country   my ancestors were here since 1750  that is keeping its people in line with the 2030 agenda.  we are in the end times and i know we must understand keeping our lives isn t the end game  we must understand we are hated for our faith just like yahshua said we would be.  i love my lil sister patriot nurse  followed her many years here. i know  great granny here  the church is and those that stay are weak and deceived afraid to step out. may yahweh strengthen you all and provide the courage that we all need to continue on this narrow road that leads to eternal life.
@jeepster gal  i just was referring to the church we attend.
remember we are all sinners in the church. the hurtful people are sinners too  and jesus gave the scripture of matthew 7 3-5 to help us when we are hurt by other christians. they think their sin isn t real vs 3 why do you see the speck that is in your brother s eye  but do not notice the log that is in your own eye  4 or how can you say to your brother   let me take the speck out of your eye   when there is the log in your own eye  5 you hypocrite  first take the log out of your own eye  and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother s eye.unfortunately too many christians want to point out or fault people for their sin without regard to their own sin. read your bible and stay in his word. a church group is for teaching and fellowship  and more   and is integral for the christian community. hopefully you will find a full gospel teaching church. god bless your efforts!
amen! i often wonder what happened to the men in church  do you think that the feminists movement pushed the men away  it seems like some pastors are careful to preach their sermon in a way as not to offend anyone. things seem so different now. it would be great if the pastors can preach the truth as the bible says it. and it would be great if the men felt welcome and respected in the church. men are still valued and needed. halleluyah!
@cjmendoza804   i m not sure if there is just one answer to this dilemma.  feminism definitely played a part but i don t think all of the blame lies there.  some of it seems to be that the church began to mirror pop culture with its tendency to make men look weak and unnecessary.  think of the typical tv sitcom dad who is always the dumb one in the scene and the butt of the jokes.  at some point and for whatever reason  the church began making men feel like they were unnecessary  superfluous and generally more trouble than they were worth.  the men for their part just shrugged  said  ok  and walked away.  this is now happening elsewhere.  i see women online making videos wondering why men don t approach them anymore and aren t seeking relationships.  men have been told for some time now that they are actually aggressors and oppressors and that the best thing that they could do for women is to leave them alone.  the men shrugged  said  ok  and walked away.  not all but many have made it clear that they are not coming back and that they see our society as one that is in decline.
as a not old guy  i get bored during most church sermons because they don t preach the hard truths. if you look at pop-culture  movies  music  etc... you ll see that they are almost all infested with what i would say are satanic ideologies.- follow your heart.  disney - do as thou wilt.  similar to follow your heart. came from aleister crowley a famous satanist - my truth.  pretty much a core tenet of woke ideology - everything is relative.  for example  only a sith lord believes in absolutes  star wars prequels etc.... churches don t call these out and sermons would be 1000x more interesting if they did. the pastor at the church service i went to today said his daughter went to a taylor swift concert while he laughed about it. while i wouldn t say this makes him an unsaved heretic  it just goes to show the spiritual blindness. after all didn t she sing about christians needing to calm down about homosexuality in the song  calm down  to give one example.
@the plasma collider   my compliments for drawing a parallel between disney and aleister crowley!  as for the whole   this is my truth  bit  these people seem to have no idea just what walking cliches they have all become.  incidentally and i can t remember where i read this  aleister crowley ended up losing everything and spent the final several years of his life washed-up and penniless  smoking pipe tobacco that had first been soaked in rum and basically waiting to die.  matthew 7 16 found its target with him.
my favorite lady with class and god fearing ! thank you for telling a harsh truth.
thank you patriot nurse! god bless you  your family and the learning folks here
it seems the church is more of a business  profit   loss enterprise  instead of a spiritual retreat!!
young lady  this is exactly spot on. i ve been dwelling on this exact line of thinking for several years now and you re the first person i ve heard to verbalize this message in this way. thank you so much  and  i am sharing this.
patriot nurse laying it out like nobody else
it is a harsh truth and frightening as to watching our world going to hell.  the entire world is under persecution the young people that are swept away and caught up in this scare me.  they are so brainwashed they have no empathy and anything goes.  nothing is wrong or evil except the people that don t agree with them.  they have been  groomed  well for years.  get the children away from the evil  out of public schools.  homeschool them.  they are destroying our children and the family so we must all sacrifice and step up.
@cherie dewald  totally agree
i didn t hear her mention jesus once in this video. i could be wrong  but i don t think she did
@eman  she s not a christian
i have seen it i have heard youth pastor bragging about making like 30 000 a year and senior pastors making more. they get a lot of grants too  from the gov. to help  troubled youth and people coming out of prisons. i think the age limit on youth is 23 after that you are on your own. it is sickening what our churches have become.
almost all churches and false  profits  here on tube are 501c3.
what church ate you talking about  the body of christ  or the catholic church
@eman    most all them !
i don t know about most people  but i ve seen things of late  that make me believe that the power of  darkness is among us. and we need the light of his word in our minds  and hearts. bless you  pn for your   as always  timely message.
as a fellow rn i m always aligned with your messages.  today  put god s word in your heart by memorizing scripture.  we may not be able to have our bibles and study as we do today.  ty!!
good report nurse!! well done.
i am not old enough to have been in wwii  but i have heard stories about atheist and non believers that found god in the foxholes on the battle fields when they needed him the most  when they truly thought all was lost! the feeling of doom was overcome and they were lifted and buoyed up by him that protected them.
sister patriot rn your words are heart piercing and soulful. we are most certainly living in biblical times as those of noah.  godspeed   shalom
patriot nurse  your words here dovetail perfectly with a message i recently watched  mankind in the world   voddie baucham. he mentions how  as an american  he never fully realized appreciated how much our country was influenced by the biblical worldview  until he went to live in zambia and things were so very different there. the whole message is well worth the time. yes  even the opening  dog story.  it s deeply relevant to the substance  not just a cute pastor s story to open a message.
thank you patriot nurse. i truly love your boldness  and look forward to every time you get on here and speak
belly up to your bible saints   the enemy is roaring like a lion  lord wants us all to be as daniel. thank you dearheart for the truth.
for all that is in the world the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life is not from the father but is from the world. i john 2 16
i don t think things get better or return to  normal  again. it seems like the times and season fit what the bible describes as end time conditions. i believe we are in the lead up to tribulation or pre-tribulation. how long this lasts is anybody s guess and until then we should all live each day giving glory to god and to jesus and put all our trust in him.
there is no need to fear death if you got god in your heart.
god bless you for utilizing the platform he gave you in passionate love of caring not only for people s practical well being  but also spiritual health. i prayed for you some years ago and it s been such an encouragement to see prayers answered and i love listening to your channel. keep fighting the good fight of faith. abundant blessings to you and your family patriot nurse! your words here put a smile on my face. i am reminded  of his goodness as you express from the wonderful  beautiful things implanted in your heart where our compass and allegiance must be and demonstrate his strength which never fails nor disappoints
god said where two or three are gathered in his name  he is there with them.the church is not a building  an organization  or a 501c3. it is an eternal adoption into the lord s holy family  through faith and repentance in jesus christ. thank you pn  stay strong  stay faithful!
thank you. i agree with this. i saw this coming when i hear ron paul saying our foreign policy should hold up to  do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  and get booed for it and another politician  who was a 2 term president and highly praised say   what if the pentagon ran itself by the sermon on the mount.  and began mocking it to laughter and cheers. i knew the end was near....
heart breaking  the scripture in matthew 7  13-14 is making so much more since to me   for the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life  and there are few who find it.  and there you go!!!
amen!
@brian gbur
may be alone though but feel part of the church.  can t make people do anything.
now days i am hearing and participating in smaller groups doing bible studies. i m finding that i am getting more out of it than when i was regularly attending church. i think it leads to more participation in a small group of 4-6 people. in this way you can dive deeper and discuss things more freely.
how can anyone enter a strong man s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man  then he can plunder his house.   matthew 12 29  stay strong people!
thank you for all you do for us me . .
good message. concise. i m convicted. i ve been too lazy.
that was so beautiful  you just taught everyone some of the most formative texts in the jewish tradition. pirkei avot - even shema yisrael!  and you did it all with a knowledge of how important these teachings are for all mankind. proud of you  patriot nurse!!!
so true!!! we are a culture that has ignored god s will. this was their plan - to condition society toward secular hedonism. the solution is to talk the talk and walk the walk  as you are so bravely doing. everyone with conscience needs to rally around people like you and support your efforts with our prayers and like minded actions.
thank you for posting. everything you said is right on sis. knowing what scripture says tells me that all that is true but his word also says the gates of hell shall not prevail against a move of god. and we are in a move right now. it s god s time to move and he is  in his people. little by little we are beginning to see an awakening taking place  where believers all across the world are beginning to wake up to his presence and power. though darkness may rear up its ugly head the true believers will take their place and let god do his thing before jesus comes. we have a job to do and that is harvesting the souls that belong to him and letting people know there is a mighty god in israel  a god of all power and love  who will prevail no matter what evil might be planning. wheat and tares have grown up together and now it s harvest time. he will have a mighty and glorious presence before he comes as the world grows darker. will there still be trouble  yes  but we as the church of the living god have a holy spirit who is here to help and teach his church to move victorious. it s his time to show off and move in the hearts of true believers. jeremiah 29 13 says that if we will search for him we will find him and he will be found by us when we seek him with all our hearts. this is the time for his glorious church to arise and do the work of an evangelist. it s god s time to shine as the world goes dark.
i love that you have done this video. i spent over 40 years  off on  writing rewriting a book and was on my final edit before release. then late last year  i was hacked . when i regained control of my computer four days later  all of my book  over 40k research docs and 100 s of hours of video research were all gone. my backup drive  it had been wiped and renamed. someone didn t want me to release the information in my book. i had a lot of information about the  church   religion and the corruption in government  especially ours  in it.i left the  church  over 10 years ago. i have never lost my faith in  god  but i became so tired of being mislead by the  church narrative  and the hypocrisy  of the members and sometimes the pastors themselves. when you study the ancient hebrew texts  you can see the changes made in the early centuries. simple changes but changes none the less. changes that change the entire narrative to allow more control over the peons...sorry  i meant church members...control that can only exist if the  church  holds the rains. people  you don t need a priest  pastor or a rabbi to speak to god. god doesn t need your money. he needs your faith  love and understanding. cut-out the middleman and get a better connection to the creator. peace and god bless!
i d be tempted to rephrase the title to this video. the church is dying in the u.s. and some european countries  but it s actually growing in many other areas...including china.
22 and thus the lord did pour out his blessings upon this land  which was choice above all other lands  and he commanded that whoso should possess the land  should possess it unto the lord  or they should be destroyed when they were ripened in iniquity  for upon such  saith the lord  i will pour out the fullness of my wrath.ether 4 22
you re a phenomenal speaker. love you sister!
what a great video  thank you!  i m a christian living in california  i see the effects of secular humanism that you describe and it s going to get a lot worse.  i came to the us from mexico at age eleven back in 1986. i think that it s precisely secular humanism-the forsaking christian values-that is destroying latin america as well.
but yet we re not to forsake the assembly of believers
@jean irwin  and yet  an assembly can happen anywhere. it doesn t have to happen on  church  property. no matter where you are  if you have an assembly of two or more  he will be there as well.
if that s what you re doing  no problem
@letsgo brandon  20for where two or three are gathered together in my name  there am i in the midst of them. there s a church.
...preach!...
people hear the word  church  any think the catholic church or an institution  or a building. they don t know that the church really means the people who believe in christ and are saved by his work on the cross.
...and also israel
a  video!fascinating perspective on past patterns and where those patterns might take us.
my church is open and functioning. we grow a bit now and again and have no problems. we are gospel focused with our minds and hearts set on jesus.
thank you patriot nurse for  going there .  the modern church has become so diluted with false teachings and narcissistic behavior from pastors and parishioners alike that i don t connect with it at all. a gospel of prosperity and self satisfaction has swept through the christian  faith  so much so that i no longer refer to myself as a christian.  i am a follower of the teachings of jesus christ.  the church i attend recently voted to leave the united methodist church because of it s progressive beliefs and it s turning away from the scriptures.  the modern seminaries are turning out pastors that don t believe in the bible and some even question the relevance of jesus to the modern church.  the bible s that have become popular today are rewritten to fit the modern belief system with significantly relevant verses edited out  a lot pertaining to fasting and prayer as a weekly practice.the pastor of our church has focused on scriptural teaching only with an emphasis on the old testament  specifically the torah.  that is  after all  what christ himself taught from. those first four books of the bible lay the foundation for everything else. ironically  the old testament is about 5 times as long as the new testament.  you can t have an understanding of the new if you don t understand the old.  thank you again for having the courage to speak the truth. god bless you.
god bless you patriot nurse for all you do and say. stay blessed!
listening to this  i kept thinking of 1 john 2 16  for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh  the lust of the eyes  and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world.
amen sistah! we are in the end times and it s gonna get much worse. john 10 10
god bless you pn!!! i love hearing your explanations of the scriptures and the world we live in!! your strength and wisdom gives me hope!
her speaking blows me away! god has gifted her.
@cathy clear  absolutely gifted!
well thank you for speaking out on this i ve trouble with it for sometime it would seem the leadership is a huge problem if the word of god was taught i think the problem would be considerably less there s considerable fear that they teach the wrong thing and when you consider they do not teach that god calls us his children meaning as we treat our children doing our best to make them better than we are it s a scary thought but it is what is written and emphasized in the teachings most of my time in church they would tell of how smart and wylie the devil is and you re talking about the one that told god he was going to put his throne above god there is no above god he doesn t have a throne and he can t this is the intelligence of we are working with their i mean consider what gabriel had to say to daniel god sent me i got this out of the book truth but only michael your angel and i agree with it now out of all the hosts of heaven and apparently god two this was put in the bible we have to judge the angels are you being prepared to do that by the church i think you see the trip to what i m saying fear it s a real problem in the church not doing or i might be wrong with god is our father we must trust him and go forth and do
7 54  to answer your question  yes. this country is filled with people that are very good at talking about all the problems in the world  but very few are willing to stand up and do what s needed to be done to slow this down. believe you me  there s no fixing this. our only option at this point is to soften the crash that is inevitably coming.
thank you so much for this breakdown.
i m so thankful to find other people in the world that are so like minded
as for me and my house we will serve the lord
i have been in pastoral ministry for over 26 years and what patriot nurse is saying is spot on. let me say that i m nothing more than a sinner saved by god s grace. i can also say that for 26 years i have faithfully preached the gospel and taught through god s word in an expository fashion. i do however take issue with those that say pastors aren t preaching what they should. my personal experience has been carnal church members who really don t want the solid preaching teaching of scripture. when the bible is faithfully proclaimed they get angry and want a pastor who will give them soft messages. much of the problem in america is that evangelical churches are full of people who think they are saved but are on their way to hell.
amen my dear sister. he moves like the wind.he builds me up from through my failures
think you are spot on again!! this world is so corrupt!!
i m impressed by the deep thought put into this presentation. thank you
excellent message patriot nurse
let s talk now i have something bigger to introduce  ......
i totally agree with you. being raised in bible believing church atmosphere i can tell you the church system has been going down hill for a long time. the system is not sacred like the scriptures. home fellowships are the answer   come out from among them and be ye separate  . even moses had to pitch his tent outside the camp because of idolatry. i have told several people   the church will end this age the same way it began this age.
i grew up in church. never thought i would leave  but i have become so disgusted with the hypocrisy. i love the lord and want to fellowship with other believers  but the judgment since i ended up a single mom in a very conservative circle and then being hit on by several so called christian married men was just more than i could bear. we listen to christian messages on tape or cd on sunday mornings and go to homeschool groups and political meetings for fellowship  because also  every single church in our area doesn t get involved with anything that really matters in the community.
you re so right that we re going to need to get close to god and in his work. i believe the testing started in the last 3 years and it really concerned me when i saw believers do things to go along to get along and saw that as a loving thing to do. we really have to pray for wisdom and discernment as we go forward.
the wrath of god is understandable !
i really wish i could afford to take a course with you. my grandmother was a nurse during the blitzkrieg over england during ww2 and served before then when it was mostly just dealing with the poor and women with no place to give birth because of parents misinterpreting the scriptures causing the women to fear for their lives if families found out they were pregnant. anyways  i never got to learn a lot from her before she died. i wish i could take courses with you because i think that you and my grandmother have a lot in common. she never stopped growing food and stocking up on food since the war until she died at age 87. her spirit came to my when i was homeless in the shelters  bathrooms with shower stalls some covered with clothing feces and blood i hadn t been able to shower much at all because the staff don t clean much at the sally but she said to me to choose the cleanest one because i would get sick if i didn t. it wasn t perfect but i got clean and avoided scabies. i don t think most people are prepared mentally for what is coming  it brings me soo much peace inside knowing that we have women like you partiot nurse to help others help others especially in the southern states which are targeted with most with anti american hatred for having white christian populations. its crazy that this is even happening it feels strange putting words to it. we know the elites are after contorl of the world but we can t underestimate the targeted stuff in america towards white christian people or people of any color of religious background that just happen to have similar beliefs of peace tolerance and understanding.
shalom p.n.  thank you for your courage to speak undiluted truth.  thank you.
excellent message.
we miraculously got a new pastor a year ago  who challenges us every week with who we are to be as christians  our biblical world views  and what is to come for us. he says  you better know scripture because it needs to be on the tip of your tongue and be able to defend it  because someday soon you ll have to choose between your faith and your life
it is simple. it is a battle for cultural supremacy of those who believe and those who do not. better to believe in something that is positive in outlook and promotes love of god  self and neighbors than to believe in the opposite  which is basically believing in nothing good. keep the good videos coming.
the church is dying   because they forgot the teachings of christ and what he taught. they chose to condemn people to hell instead of showing them the actual love of christ. they would see more people come to christ if they chose love like he commanded  read the 10 commandments if you have an issue with what i m writing  but instead they choose hate  judgment  selfishness  pride and greed to rule them.
she s a jew.
did she mention jesus in this video even once
@eman  patriot nurse is an amazing woman  a true believer in yahushua jesus and a very brave lady. simply because she did not mention the name of our savior in this particular video does not lessen the undiluted truth she spoke.her life reflects yahushua. the book of ester never mentions the name of yhwh even once  yet the evidence of his holy presence is displayed throughout.
god really convicted my heart about how i really feel about jesus   if i m not passionate about jesus christ how can i expect others. david gibbs jr is such a great preacher and has helped me.  i attend my church at every service!!
another   amazing  presentation  of   important  information  that  impacts  us  all  regardless whether  you are    religious   or  not.  what  a  mind!    what  a  teacher  !!
thank you so much.  we need voices like yours in these very scary times.
one of the worst things to happen to  churches  in the us  is the ability to become a non-profit 501c3 organization.
amen  sister  speak that truthbut also have faith that god will sustain his true church18 and i tell you  you are peter  and on this rock i will build my church  and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.matthew 16
the church i go to is one of the only churches in the u.s. maintaining a stable population. i accredited it to the emphasis on having healthy families. you can t keep the membership up if you don t have a next generation.
i have served as senior pastor for over 42 years behind the pulpit.  our churches were all independent and free of any ecclesiastical control apart from the word of god.  that said  i have witnessed the decline and falling away of even these churches.  invitations go unheeded  baptistries remain unfilled  and calls for teachers workers are unanswered.  business models have replaced personal holiness and evangelism.  a few years ago  i retired from the pulpit and now reach multiple more through online bible studies.  we still need personal fellowship but it s nearly impossible to find in church bodies that have but a small percentage of true believers.
is it about numbers
@jeepster gal  i think it is. as the numbers of christians grew societies were moved away from very horrific practices like infanticide. now as the number of christians diminish our society now has plenty of broken families  dead babies  and broken individuals who engage in destructive vices.  if we want to preserve the morals of the next generation we need to have as many of them coming unto christ. bringing as many souls to christ as possible is the only thing that i believe can reverse our societal collapse. the gospel of christ has healed families and individuals.
@jeepster gal  nah  it s all about empowerment  anti racism  diversity  equity  and inclusion. unless you re one of the  number  left out.
thank you for your clear message!
so well said. sadly  those who most need to get this message won t have the ears to hear  to comprehend it.
this one is outa the park and into the next county and ... still bouncing ! ! !wgt pn ! ! !  keep up the great work .. god bless you to the moon and back ! ! !
every word you said is true. thank you.
great video and analysis. thanks.
you re right girl! believers need to be in a body of like minded people  they are still out there!
woe to them that call evil good and good evil  are not the times we are going into. that is because we are already there - and it is entrenched. only god can fix this mess.
a country that turns its back on god almighty can know longer expect his protection  i believe he has lifted his finger of protection from america   this will not end well . god bless you patriot nurse may gods grace be upon us all we need deeply
i m praying  for you pn that you are safe from the weather we are having.the churches are  falling.more
i love that you are talking about this. i had to stop going to my church because they were talking politics at the pulpit and of course woke at that. shameful.
she s a jew. this should answer you.
the bible says that there will be a great falling away of the church in the final days  and many will be deceived. i believe that is what we are seeing. as for me  i will cling to the word of god! so that i m not deceived. i continue to watch and pray.
wow - this helps me understand the divisions in america now.   the greatest result of education is tolerance.   so true!
i hope that you find a bible teaching  christ-centered church soon  and are able to return with happiness to church.
interesting insights  and i totally agree patriot nurse! will the remnant stand fast or go the way of the autumn leaves...
let no one deceive you by any means  for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first. 2 thessalonians 2 3
i believe that the church is shrinking.  sunday service is down a lot.  it has to do with minister s.  but on the other hand i went to the movie jesus revolution  i think that is what it was called.  the theater was packed and almost ever showing was like that.  the other movie theater s in the building we almost empty.  if we start praying the woke individuals will go away  or back the other place then heaven.
as a great bible teacher   pastor has said in relation to the covid shutdowns of churches.....   those churches that let themselves get closed  needed to be closed!
sorry i missed the premiere this time  but liked and shared. welcome back from nashville and thanks for the historical perspective again of patterns into our future
i go to a survival church  called we are the church. we meet whenever two or more are gathered in his name.  yep the body of christ is alive and well. we are a fiery remnant  full and activated. we don t play church. we are the church
hay gal  i always knew i d be joining in your ranks of widowhood! yes  i too am a widow. i just couldn t stop thinking about you when i lost my husband in august of 2021.god bless you and what you do. keep on going.    you diana baughan.
thank you for a very timely message.
true. there is a believing  remnant  that puts god s truth above all else  and we re not the majority but  we re not supposed to be. stay vigilant and faithful. speak up for god s truth and less to feelings. you will never be loved by the world. jesus said so.
the mainline churches may be losing attendee s but home churches are growing .. big time..  look around you probably have one in walking distance from your front door.. nothing like worshipping outside..it just feels right.. peace to you all.. walk with god there is no other.. i see a revival across the country
the church will become small but mighty.  pope benedict xvi said the catholic church would become smaller.  however  those catholics in that small church would be on fire for christ.
good to see you pn  god bless keep   sustain you now   always. shalom.
yes!   that is true.  i wish that our evangelical brothers and sisters would realize that true catholicism is christ centered.
thank you as always!! god bless you!!
thank you for your insights..i think your right..i mean some people will do anything ..i call them idiots..i m not with them .i m with god ..our lord.
that was a beautiful sermon  and you are not wrong.
lust of the eyes  lust of the flesh  and the pride of life.
love your channel.  it s the church system that flesh created that s failing.   the true church is going strong.
i left the church 11 years ago when it became acceptable for girls to wear barely anything to church and then condemned a young girl for getting pregnant  my daughter.  i mean condemned her and openly. i taught her more at home then she ever learned there. compassion was my 1st lesson
i was recently reminded how difficult it s been these last three years to resist what the world was pushing for for everyone and listening to the lord saying to wait. but  almost all our christian friends gave in to pressures from the world  especially the churches. we were very disappointed in so many local and prominent preachers and pastors these last three years. the reality of what it takes to have faith and be obedient to god alone is frighteningly meager.   what will christians do when persecution comes  fold fight for god s kingdom  it takes a strong daily walk with him for a prolonged time to develop the ability to listen to god s still small voice.
you always put it so well!!!!
i am currently on a committee concerning this very thing in the catholic church  but the church is truly receding across the board in all of christendom worldwide. we are fighting to keep 15 churches in our archdiocese-two of which my committee is responsible for. it s a struggle to begin the fight at the back end of the devil s centuries long attack which gained tremendous traction in the 20th century  but we can do all things in christ who strengthens us!
god bless you for always speaking the truth.
how many times can i like this! rock on!
right on the button.  when we drift from religion  the void is filled with power lust just as you said.  this is where we funded ourselves today.
read his word. be faithful to him. be confident. he will win in the end  and bring his faithful with him.
a i feel like my church doesn t ever touch the world problems.   they do have good lessons and i think that s why i go.  i have many other resources for biblical knowledge.  my daughter also loves youth group and helping the sunday school.
amen! totally agree!
damn you re so spot on.
brilliant observation  sister! sadly  and unfortunately i believe you are right on.
this is the message for this hour ! and god will bless you for your faithfulness !  not one word.. will return to him void  !! but shall accomplish that which he purposes
let no one deceive you by any means  for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first  and the man of sin is revealed  the son of perdition
this is dosturbing... and you re  right... and really  this is.. powerful.  thousand percent truth.
testify!!!!
the church as an institution in america isn t dying  it s largely already dead. live in the heart of bible belt south and have seen nothing but corruption and superficiality. reminds me of god mentioning israel in ot as worshipping with their mouths but their hearts are not with me  paraphrase . quit going and view independent bible study as only viable option for now. to those of us with a bible-focused small church that hasn t caved  count your blessings!
my little bible church is becom8ng increasingly woke. woke .they things they say and push... they are still mostly adhering to biblical truth  bit 3 weeks ago  our 40 ish pastor announced during his sermon he has no problem with yoga... yoga is an eastern religious system of enlightentenment ... it is deeply steeped in hinduism..i almost walked out.. now i wished i had.
good talk pn. you re looking well and healthy again! god bless
i love you!  keep speaking the truth.
you rock patriot nurse!
that is so sad. but yes  this poison is everywhere. i encourage you to start researching other churches.
john adams was correct  there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties  each arranged under its leader  and concerting measures in opposition to each other. this  in my humble apprehension  is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our constitution.
good morning everyone!! much love to all.
thank you  never have i been so thankful to me right here in these mountains. hang on
thanks  patriot nurse.  good words !
appreciate your feedback ...do well to drop a note....let s talk  directly
popular democracy is abhorrent to the blessings of god.
great points! thanks sister! shalom!
hey p.n. so happy to have the privilege to be watching your talk vid. right here at 6 32 in i had to say you are so right about the instant gratification and the perverting of our nation i am 58 and a former product of extreme mental  physical emotional  and sexual abuse.just the fact that i can openly say that is part of healing but without yeshuah hamashiach i would be of no value. it s his mercies that create our value..otherwise we would all be fodder...i truly believe clear thinking like you exhibit  is imperative to our survival..thank you god bless you ma am....
patriot nurse  you are exactly right.  our founding fathers made a covenant with the god of the bible  which is a two-edge sword.  careful obedience to god results in huge blessing.  however  ignoring god and his commands results in huge curses.  as an example  with the ultra sexual perversion we are now seeing  in response god promises to  vomit the inhabitance out of the land .  since 2007  i have been witnessing a constant falling away from true biblical study  and as christians  we are commanded to study god s word  not simply read it .  i roughly estimate less than 1  of the churches in the us are recognized by the god of the bible as being genuine.  churches are by far arminian today  a false doctrine that says anyone can accept or reject christ jesus  the messiah s offer of salvation.  scripture however says this is not possible  as human nature hates continually the god of the bible  see romans 3 10 - 18 .  god the father uses his gospel to save and draw whomever he desires and his son  jesus provided all the sacrifice necessary to accomplish paying the penalty for their sin.  also  john 3 16  quoted so often as proof god loves everyone  which goes against romans 9 6 -33  is actually a command  not an offer.all churches today in the us  except a handful that preach the truth of god s word  focus wholly on entertainment  lively music and an interesting sermon with typically one verse of scripture that is not offensive to the unsaved  and therefore  are not recognized by god.  there is no emphasis to study god s word so you can actually know the only true savior.  without god s word being used as a moral standard  it is the same predicament as a ship in the ocean during a hurricane  where the rudder is broken and the engines dead  the country will fall away in one generation to all manner of curses  suffering  and death as the government degenerate into organized crime.the churches must place christ jesus far above all else and diligently study god s word  the bible   2 timothy 2 15-16  2 timothy 3 16-17  hebrews 4 12-13    otherwise false teachers quickly come in and destroy the church along with any blessing the church provides to society  2 peter 2 1-2 .
preach it.
very powerful video  very motivating  still chewing on it 1john 2 16
the more the deceivers get pushed into a corner the higher deception will get. may christ jesus put a hedge around you where ever you are. thank you for another great video
what is it she preached  what s the takeaway  i didn t hear her mention jesus once
@eman  all truths are of god  she preached truth.
big red flag  if your pastor  board of elders  whatever  is more interested in getting more members than in supporting missions  find another church.
so the hard part is we aren t to forsake our coming together but it s hard as heck to find a body of believers that hasn t been fouled.
i wish i could give this video two thumbs up! we are facing tyranny right now here in the good ole usa. what do you call the jan 6th prisoners
when i return will there be any faith   jesus christ.
god is faithful to his people! remember that always!
holding on tightly with both hands and my heart!
god bless you sister.
patriot nurse i envy your family and friends i can t wait to talk with you in heaven. you are a blessing sister!
church is dying just as much in canada  where i live and has been for a very long time.
there is nothing here worth being separated from our father  and our  savior. amen shalom.
thank yoiu for your words of wisdom!
i have a personal relationship with god and i do not need a church to do that but i do see your points.
wisdom can still found on the internet
amazing  pn. god inspired for sure  the facts of the day.
we are already there sister.
didn t jesus say  when i return how many will i find that have faith
the church i belonged to was more like a social club than a religious organization.  they seem to believe in heaven on earth through social programs.
excellent presentation.  inspired!
good called evil and evil called good . . .don t you know we are already there .  .  . may our god look your way pn .  .   .
this woman! thank you for all you do to speak truth.
@beckderm  i don t care if she s purple. she speaks the truth
thank you.
thank you sister.part of the failing of the church in the west is that most of it has been fed the lie of a  secret escape   while revelation 13 7  book of daniel and many other scriptures in the nt point towards the saints being required to endure to the end  revelation 1-2   and specifically in revelation 13 7  the antichrist being given authority by god himself to  overcome the saints .this tells me that we will be required to live as our current persecuted brothers and sisters do. making christ known  and literally laying down our lives in the process.
i ve noticed a revival. i feel the revival. but yes. it s all under attack!
thank you for your needed info.  may i ask if there is any way you can turn the volume up on your end    even on my high setting on my phone your vids volume seems very low.  thanks so much.  love your common sense approach to your topics.
just found your channel good word  god bless
i ve been around since the sunglasses days and love your online  downloadable  class. my question to you   the group is how do i learn how to navigate crypto currency
yes you are correct! revival is indeed happening  god has brought me back into his  fold  after a too long sinful hiatus keep praying for those who are on your hearts  and for the lost  god s hand is not short!
well said
amen! i am a bible-believing christian struggling to find a true church home  and community. i noticed you make many references in your videos to our jewish roots  and the old testament. if you don t mind me asking  are you a torah observant christian  if so  can you refer me to some resources for learing about torah-observant christinity   i would so appreciate it!
so perfectly said.... thank you for your faith and intellect.
amen pn!  the scriptures were and are forever a god breathed inspired documentation that proves god is the creator and only means of salvation of mankind.  to reject god is a eternal suicide into an everlasting contempt of torment.  rejectors must repent and believe the scriptures to seek and know god and his gospel of salvation for mankind. he saves and helps those who are sincere who calls out to him  in yeshua jesus name.
@patriotnurse2 fake acct
exactly !!!
i and a group of people across the nation  from new york state to california  study torah by zoom every saturday. some believe  all find value in the word.
sure need more like you pn
become a tlm catholic.
@deborah sturm  respectfuly  no. i was born and raised catholic  attended catholic schools  and mass weekly  sometimes more. been there  done that  never going back.
rabbi berkson at messianic torah observant israel  mtoi  has posted a lot of videos here on youtube. his   heart of the matter   series is excellent.
it depends on where you are at in the country  as to what is available to you. i live in nw arkansas and there are many torah observant fellowships here!
remnant house ministries on youtube
you might be interested in jonathan cahn.
the object  of our biblical faith must always be  jesus christ and him crucified  the message of the cross
@sarah ann  the tlm stands for traditional latin mass as in the real mass of the ages and of the saints.  i m betting you are a vatican ii novus ordo raised catholic which is not the same thing at all. the church was modernized into something non catholic around 1968-1970.  look into the history.  you are a casualty of vatican ii.
@kathryn myer  no  i know what the difference is. attended both. catholicism in any way  shape  or form  is not biblical and not for me.
unfortunately  the bible does not prophesy that things are going to get better. in fact  they will only get worse until christ s returns. the hour is late.
the church isn t a denomination. it s believer followers as a whole. these unsure days are causing the church to show it s true colors. the lukewarm  self interest  false teachers and false prophets won t make it.
@sarah ann  i felt i should come back here and comment again. i don t know where you hail from  but the fellowship i attend in arkansas is called torah family fellowship. it is truly wonderful. such loving folks with a zeal for the entire word. there is also a youtube channel called torah family. a few other channels i enjoy are   hanging on his word    kingdom in context  and   wes blaze muzik  also  wildly unpopular   i shy away from rabbinical teachings  as these are not true to the word. just more of man s teachings. i don t listen to any  rabbi  . there is just too much traditions of man in those teachings. be careful who you listen to. not everyone who says  torah  are a true follower of god.
@mountain mama  thank you so much for the resources!
@sarah ann  you are very welcome  sister!
how do i find this
it s no wonder a revival has begun sweeping they the nation! these are the end times so certain things must come to pass  as in the book of revelation!! exciting times! jesus come collect your people! xx
.!  well said patriot nurse .!
while all this is true  i have met many atheists and agnostics who believe strongly in the constitution and natural rights of man.  we as christians need all the help we can get  and we must also serve as examples for those who broadly share our worldview  even if they don t share our faith.  after all  faith in god is something that can be gained through time and patient ministry.
agreed! u tell it my sister.!!
god is separating the wheat from the tares.
i will keep my beliefs and the cross on the eve of my home outside and don t care who likes or who doesn t my house is my church
well said  well spoken. bravo!!
i agree 100 . i hate to say it but i attended church all of my 40 some years of life but in last 7 years i quit going because i was getting nothing from preaching or teaching. i have to listen to a handful of preachers not from my home area. the local church is dead.
thank you very much for speaking the truth. way to much compromising the holy bile. doctrine matters. a spiritual awakening is needed.have a beautiful and blessed week. lord god bless and stay vigilant.
there s much to unpack with said subject
patriot nurse  will you please discuss chabad   noahhide law   how it will affect christians
for values  the culture is going to be forced to give up their obsession with convenience.convenience is often antagonistic to patience  a value that the public severely lacks.
excellent word. the  church  sadly ceased having any power or sway in the country when they chose 501 c 3 tax status over the status of being torah observant followers of yeshua. even much earlier when they removed the ten commandments from the walls of schools  public buildings and most egregiously from the pulpits  and even worse removed the tenakh from the  christian  bible  we gave the reigns of the nation over to hasatan and his system and followers. the broad road is one major traffic jam now. i pray every day that hashem will open the eyes of his people to see all that the adversary has deceived them into believing and following after.
please share this video far and wide!!
i don t think you have to be concerned about that.  but if you look at some of the noah hide laws  they seem to resemble some of the 10 commandments
hey there..we want ur live teaching conferences in the north east..please schedule in the future in de  pa  or nj

thepatriotnurse  from one sabbath keeper to another  you would be blessed to read or listen to the free audiobook of the great controversy  there is also a dramatized version  on youtube.
i think you do a great job bringing the information to people and everything else that you are doing. i have been subscribed for several years and still enjoy it. please don t stop. it would be a great loss.charles
in other words  the bible prophecy is playing out right before us. read your bible and hold fast to the truths therein. the only hope we have is in jesus christ
it is written. who would have thought we would be watching! total agreement on all points.
orthodoxy is seeing a huge influx of young people. brings us a lot of hope and joy. all glory to god!
this is so true. and so sad.
my word will not return to me empty. isaiah    god knows what he s doing.the prophesies will come in the proper time.be faithful and  pray.do not fret.  do not worry.. jesus has overcome the world.
yes and amen thankyou you are precious  prayers for youfrom alaska in y shua the messiah the anointed almighty shepherd king  of his kingdom there is no end
the church has been sad for years now can t get to truth   bible prophecy
my church 1970s was filled to capacity every sunday......they had to tell the congregants to move to the middle of the pews to make room on the ends.....then all the white folks moved out of that area and attendance went to minimal.
hope to see u at this year s nra meetings at indy on april 14th! excellent topic and views. lookin beautiful as always patriot nurse!
can you talk about what s happening in israel ! it would be nice to hear from you on israeli news!
beans  bullets  bandages    bible!
to find a bible based believing church is  mission impossible  now sad but it is the endtimes being a born-again christian is becoming a tough calling as the world becomes darker living for christ is easier said than done but it is truly amazing watching the one world system as foretold in the bible coming to pass called by god to live out our calling in the end of the age is definitely exciting stand on the rock of christ jesus and live the gospel   spirit filled  life  only living it out shows that its real god bless
i just got to like hillsong  and they got into finance trouble.  also  the mormon church was fined 4 million dollars for hiding money.  i found a women s ministry i like online.  we re in ephesians.
when your governments trying to get you to forget about them documents the best thing you can do is remind yourself of them documents in your case the constitution in my case the magna carta and the english bill of rights
it s about a personal relationship with self and god  we don t need a third party
thank you   you are 100
the good is bad   bad is good is already here. the church as an institution is crumbling. most of them have gone woke. it s scary. it s why i don t go to church. it s so embedded that the majority of parishes will go against you if you call out the truth. the personal relationship with god and selective fellowship is so important.  we have a duty to touch those we can reach.  the church is collecting souls for satan  not god. it s lunacy.
john 12 24 nasbtruly  truly  i say to you  unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies  it remains alone  but if it dies  it bears much fruit.
there is a great shaking going on! hebrews 12 27  kjv   and this word  yet once more  signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken  as of things that are made  that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.2 timothy 3 5  kjv   having a form of godliness  but denying the power thereof  from such turn away.

here from oklahoma
the church age is coming to an end . don t hang on to the world  keep your eyes on jesus.
fundamental bible churches are no longer   go ye into all the world and preach the gospel  but are social clubs.
i agree with you 100
most are now man centered and not god centered. gather christian friends and rotate. church in home is so rewarding. worship is for believers. go out and share the gospel all throughout your week as god commands us. god bless.
thanks for your channel.
dying in the city. not in the smokie mountains where i m at. in fact its growing. but yes i agree with you on the broader subject. have a great day patriots!amen
god is alive. the faithful will remain.
we talked about that today. some ministers r forgetting the gospel of christ. their not seeing the forrest for the trees. the gospel is the church s meant n taters. its not about golf outings etc. its about worship n learning more about the bible together. people make up the church. were not perfect but leaders need to be held accountable. big problem is the break down of the family. that
thank you
yep! i agree. i m messianic and understand.  my word to my friends at our messianic congregation is scriptures  period.  some want to flower up with their own words for attention.  but to me nothing is greater than our lord s voice  his word. he is the word. i m not legalistic but what i do  love is the scriptures and stick and cling to yeshua jesus.  when we do it s a surety we will not be deceived we will be discerning.  that is the whole torah. genesis to revelation   please dear ones read the whole bible.  then no one can take it away because it will be in your heart. thank you p.n.
well said!  you are so wise and astute pn!
for the church s to survive  they need to go back to providing the services that they once used too  private child care  education  schools  hospitals  etc. etc. etc. even when offered free to the public  these institutions provide beneficial services that tend to encourage church participation from a larger segment of the population  particularly those that directly benefited.
thanks for the video. i can agree mostly with what you have said here  especially on the assertion that the absence of god s word puts us in extreme danger of being subject to our flesh  or human nature as you have called it. but there is one thing that i see over and over that seems to be going under everyone s  radar.  the bible says that the end times would be unprecedented. that the times to come in the end would have never occurred theretofore  nor ever been repeated. they are indicative of and to the time they happen. so why is it that most  believers  seem to agree we are in  or at the birth pains of  the end of days but can t seem to take their eyes off those dusty history books  fair enough if your perspective is that we are not in fact at the birth pains or end of days. also  i wholeheartedly believe that knowing and studying history is of tremendous value so as not to repeat past mistakes as well as learning to identify the signs of that repeating. but if your belief is that we are in or around the last days then i assert that maybe it is better to put the history books away and start looking at what the bible says. you will find that a one world government will be set up to take away borders  sovereignty  and personal freedoms in favor of collectivism. this is obviously my summary and not word for word. what if america is the actual beast system  what if this is not god s kingdom  but rather satan s  what if this country never loses its power  as it should according to historical norms  but instead continues to take out the last bastions of sovereignty to unite the world under the beast system that s been established here. i am only suggesting that maybe our current interpretations are through the lens of the past when our messiah has said that the future will be unique. this country  usa  is not of god  this country is part of  the nations.  god s nation is isreal which is a spiritual remnant for now  but soon will be a completely regathered nation in the land god promised our true forefathers  abraham  isaac  and jacob. for what it s worth to you  i just wanted to try to offer a deeper perspective on the topic. again thanks for the video and take on things. blessings to you.
so what s your thoughts on  is ra el  outlawing christianity over there after your prase of  is ra el  over your friend s deadly encounter
so true!
unless the church repents and starts teaching the whole counsel of scripture we re toast. it s amazing that the lord just doesn t sodom and gomorrah us. the solution is simple. repent!. receive jesus as savior before it s too late!
the true can never die but the tares and wheat are being separated.  the good fish are being kept and the bad fish tossed.  the fig tree that bears no fruit will whither.
childcare shouldn t be necessary because mom should stay home.
i just realized looking at the name of your channel  the initials spell out tpn  and that s what you kind of are for everybody because you are giving them exactly what everyone needs to survive and thrive not only nutritionally but  spiritually as well. god is in control and he will have the last say period  so continue to occupy until he comes.
we know to never rely on the arm of man for we are all sinners.  be ready before the tribulation occurs. the wrath of god will come whenever he says.
we as believers must get serious about our personal sin  repent and get healthy. plead to god for renewal and revival. 2 chronicals 7 14.
i just sat through a sermon about this very topic only the guest speaker said that america was never a christian nation. that the founding fathers were in fact not christian.  and our pastor last week preached a sermon about the  acts church   where everyone sold all their possessions and lived in one accord very much out of context. needless to say  i have one foot out the door of that church but the problem is  where do we go to worship  this is type of mentality is rampant all around me.
open our eyes lord!
well state-run christianity  501c3  has been horrific for america. romans 10 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus  and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead  thou shalt be saved.
and upon this rock i will build my church  and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it. jesus s ekkelesia will always remain until he comes again.
they are afraid of the government! many preachers or ministry are teaching all weak sermons and act like nothing going on in the world  many don t talk on current events as it relates to biblical last days events
in 1986  i was cooking a meal and i heard a voice and i thought a person was right behind me and this voice said to me  organized religion will fail. i am now watching it being played out. dietrick bonhoeffer from the1930 s saw churches in the us compromising when he visited and said there needs to be an awakening in churches. for him to see that almost a100 years ago should tell you to open our eyes. he laid down his life for christ. are we able to do the same. he became a martyer to the thugs of the nazi. i pray that we will pass the test and lay down our life for christ. if we are called to do the same. shalom
the bishop of brooklyn sent a letter to priests not to sign religious exemptions for cv-19
thank you.
day s of noah  it is written in the bible what is happening today. you can date it by the creation of israel.
we are now living in a time worse than the days of noah  pretty much past the point of no return.  repent  read god s word every day and get ready for whatever is ahead. no fear.
people are turning away from god because they re extraordinarily selfish. in other words  they worship themselves. it s so sad and they will be held accountable for the path they chose.

i am the true vine  and my father is the vinedresser. every branch in me that does not bear fruit  he takes away  and every branch that bears fruit  he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit. you are already clean because of the word which i have spoken to you. abide in me  and i in you. as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine  so neither can you unless you abide in me. i am the vine  you are the branches  he who abides in me and i in him  he bears much fruit  for apart from me you can do nothing. if anyone does not abide in me  he is thrown away as a branch and dries up  and they gather them  and cast them into the fire and they are burned.john 15 1 - 6
indeed the  institutionalized church  has been overmanaged and underled for decades. this includes churches that are solid in the letter of their theology.
a lot of the denominations are splitting because some want to follow the desires of the world an others want to follow what god wants.
keep waiting .no one is coming back to save the delusional. you believe that because your parents believed it from their parents. and so on ..when will you think for yourself and not in what your parents believed.
@richard spera  i thought about whether to respond to any part of your comment and i decided to point out that my parents were not true believers one catholic the other methodist. 6th grade i found jesus when i attended a southern baptist church and knew that this is where i belonged. eventually my whole family of eight joined as well. i understand you re either a non-believer or someone that was hurt by a previous church as that often happens too. on this channel you will find an abundance of believers in jesus christ which i am sure you can tell by the different comments  and some have left their previous church as well for various reasons and hopefully they will find some place that offers what we all truly seek in life peace that only a heavenly father  a savior like jesus christ  and the holy spirit that can guide us through our daily walk so one day we all can be together for all eternity because hell is where no one wants to be for all eternity.

spot-on
so beautiful
so good  u explained it great!
jesus promised that the gates of hell would  not destroy the church so i m stickin  with him !
amen
i remember a prophecy where it says that half the church will fall away and toward the end half of that half will fall away.
the federal reserve global digidollar collar will be the mark of the statecraft beast!
thank god the church i attend is following christ verse by verse none of the nonsense of the world . i would not attend if it was anything else except jesus christ as our lord and savior     ! history has a way of repeating itself by sinful wicked people!
this dying effect is also tied to shrinking family size. although couples may certainly raise beautiful families with one or two children  the world benefits in many ways from  middle children   who often bring the virtues of compromise  harmony  and selflessness to society. additionally  catholics have discovered that religious callings are much higher in families with four or more children.
thank you !
there are churches all over the country that look like they are abandoned or hardly ever used.
i have many friends  many friends  that have not picked up the word  in years. when they speak of problems  i usually ask- what did our lord have to say about that issue   i don t remember   is usually the answer. or  they say   that is why i called you  to ask ... . god has not left his people  his people have left him. none of my friends know the torah  but they can site you 100 reasons why it s ok  to chance your sexual identity. the bible is not being removed by the hitler s so to speak. the people have chosen to lay it down  and that is what allows those kind of people  to step in and mow a nation down! it is written  if my people  who are called by my name  will humble themselves and pray  and seek my face  and turn from their wicked ways  then i will hear from heaven  and will forgive their sins and heal their land.
i been watching you for year s and your are still one of the most beautiful woman i have ever seen on and off youtube.
agreed we have done church wrong for a long time. acts 2
not just plant our feet firmly on the ground ... but build on the solid rock that jesus spoke of .....
amen!
wheat vs tares.
a nations favour is won and lost via the nature of the voices from the pulpit.
the church died a long time ago.  the body is alive and well.   many are called  few are chosen
it also says many will grow cold and fall away. i think it s both. the remnant will be small in comparison to the entire population.
there always a remnant sister. in these end times there will be no big denominational churches that are true   it will be small local congregations  and we will win.
our founding fathers believed in  separation of church and state. and probably really didn t care if there were atheist or people of other religions working in public office.
yah is doing a new thing now.i believe that what he wants is a new testament church.i believe that if we want what they had we are going to have to do what they did.look closely at the daily life of the new testament people.
it s worse than you think. if i didn t know better  i would say we are witnessing the plot of invasion of the body snatchers.
the church died in 2020 mmxx when the pastor s  priest s  bishop s  etc didn t stand up and keep their door s open.
the moral fiber and respect for the common culture are the backbone that holds any civilization together. once those two things are gone the end of the civilization begins. the usa will not survive intact in its present form. we have become an amoral  anti-god group of people who can t stand one another. politically and morally  we are divided in a way that is beyond function or repair. the usa will break up in different ways. those of us with like minds culturally will physically separate ourselves from others and we will get together in what i believe will be a sort of post-union balkanization. but the system will crash and burn first. the states will re-exert their powers  and we re gradually going to see the hopelessly corrupt federal bureaucracy in washington dc lose a lot of the control it now has.
in my opinion.  church when they do as jesus said is great. but when it becomes a business then i  can see immoral things going on. i personally just talk to god without church and feel his presence while doing it. idk there are some churches doing good things. but america is losing its faith and that was it s strongest point.

jesus alone saves and god s people must share the faith and truth that has kept us free.
my dear  i did deep dive with kjv then hebrew with history and culture  and many doctrines  was wrong  now my spiritual life is with prime creator
i bowed the knee to jesus christ more than 50 years ago  but i do not attend church  and that is because i know of no church worth attending. as social clubs  they re pretty good.  that s about it.people who understand little about christianity go to these churches because they think that- church attendance is what you really need  and being in the group  or in a group  has meaning as far a god is concerned  so they go to  feel a part of something   to listen to some religious-sounding music  to maybe be seen carrying a bible  etc  and to hear a message  sometimes from a pastor wearing a religious-looking costume  thinking that it s important to do so.  it s really just religious showmanship.  ...something for your eyes.and  often  the message is good  but it is so often lacking in the elements that are really needed  and so often the churches are full of false beliefs.  the people are handed doctrines from the ministry  which are basically handed down and are nothing more than tradition  and that stay alive mainly because people  and pastors  just repeat what they have heard  never verifying the beliefs in the bible.just a few examples  the bible does not support the idea that when christians die  they go to heaven. they do not. when we die  we go to the grave and we stay there until jesus calls us up from the grave.  thus  the word   resurrection   and there is a lot more to go into this subject.  too much to include here.another area that the churches fail  they embrace other pagan traditions  such as christmas and easter  and many tolerate or even celebrate halloween.  these are all completely non-biblical.  what does a jolly fat man in a red suit have to do with the birth of christ   hmmm..    eight tiny reindeer...   give me a break!  we need to grow up!how would it go over if it was your birthday and i celebrated your birthday by buying presents for all my other friends and family   hmmm...   think about it if you dare.did jesus tell us to celebrate his birthday   hmmm   did jesus celebrate his own birthday  did jesus celebrate  birthday   hmmm   did the apostles celebrate christmas   did the early church celebrate christmas   does your pastor perpetuate this stuff what does the easter bunny have to do with the resurrection of christ   hmmm   why do we allow sunday school teachers to perpetuate this... stuff    where do we get this k-rapp  the pastors are not going to take a stand against this because they know that the people come to hear what they want to hear and expect to hear.  and the pastors will tell them what they want to hear and not what they need to hear. weak pastors  weak church.my 6 year-old grandson asked me if he was a  scorpio .  i was astonished to hear the question.  i asked him where he got that idea.  he said- from his grandma  other side of the family  grandma .  well  guess what!  his grandma is a regular attendee of a prominent  christian fellowship  in our area.  i went over and had a little sit-down talk with one of the assistant pastors at her fellowship.  who knows if that will have done any good  but you can count on this  i will be countering all the false beliefs that emanate from grandmas and churches  to at least give my grandson a chance to avoid this deception  and  i m happy to say that when the pastor of one of the local institutions  found that i had printed up a small article showing the truth about easter   it s not biblical.  and that i had given it to my grandson s church school teacher  both she and the pastor became unhinged. i also asked pastor gary the question about a  jolly fat man in a red suit ...he quickly and artfully changed the subject  and not in a happy tone.  he was definitely feeling insecure about his  club .  you teach lies and paganism to my grandson in the name of christ  and i will counter those lies.  count on it.and  in the book of revelation  jesus spoke of the laodiceans and false teachers and he was not giving them any encouragement.  read it and heed it.  don t expect your hired pastors to tell you anything but what they think you want to hear. that s why the church is weak and is dying.  time to repent.   pc   most churches don t even teach that idea.
without obedience to yhwh  it never was alive.....shalom.
the revelation. 1 the revelation of jesus christ  which god gave unto him  to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass  and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john  2 who bare record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ  and of all things that he saw. 3 blessed is he that readeth  and they that hear the words of this prophecy  and keep those things which are written therein  for the time is at hand. -king james version.

there s talk in the comments that one need not go to church  but merely be with other believers. it s said the church is not a building  but the people. this is a line fed to the american church for probably 50 years. and it is a line  that has contributed to the dying or shrinking of the visible church. the problem with this line is that it merely provides proof texts  but no exegesis  and it ignores the entire question on what exactly did god intend when he instituted the church. that s right  church is not mans idea  but gods. god orders the worship  god defines the terms  and  contrary to moralistic  therapeutic deism of the american church  church is not about us serving god  but he is serving us  communion  the preaching of the word.  god gave us teachers  pastors  and so on  for the building up of the body of christ until we reach the unity in the faith. now  i do not believe one has to go to seminary to be called of god  but certainly the church is not merely the church in 2023. god has been growing the church for 2000 years  and we can learn from those who ve gone before. gathering with you fellow christians  say in your home  and reading some scripture  and the having everyone tell each other what gods word means to them  is not preaching. in fact  it may not even be biblical. there is only one meaning of the text. yes  there are many applications  but long before we get to the application  we need to know the meaning  and that doesn t tend to happen among those who see church where two or there are gathered. there is much more to church than the amount of people. now  i understand  very well  the frustration in finding a solid church. i know what it s like to travel 45 mins to a church  i know what it s like to find lack of fellowship  i know what its like to find a church that actually preaches the word  in law and gospel. my wife and i left the church we were married in because of bad doctrine  and we struggled for years to find a church. but this is no excuse to not go to church. is it possible there is not solid church in your area  sure. but i d remind you  my 45 min trek to church  is nothing. folks at my church just returned from a missions trip  and there were people there who walked 2 hours  one way  to go to church. so  as inconvenient  and yes  difficult for fellowship  it may be  most of us will be able to find a good church. are the exceptions  yes  but even then  we must be careful. if you re living in a communist country where you can t meet in public  certainly house churches are ok. but again  its not about where  as much as how. can 5 christians have church in their home  yes  but what does it look like  again  god defines the term  he tells us how to worship  and even shows us  through acts  how the governing of the church should be. he gives us elders  deacons etc.. there is likely fast coming a time where the true church will not be permitted to meet in america. we need to understand now  what are the elements of church  and prepare for them for this coming time....together...and forsake the assembling together.
i was talking about it the other day and most don t go to church anymore when i was a kid everyone went to church
i agree with everything you have said here.. our republic has left our creator. they removed prayer in school   the ten commandments from gov. office s and the public squares.  we all need to stand on the rock   jesus christ   so we do not sway or fall. i left the church building made by man many year s ago. we cannot allow ourselves to be deceived and use our discernment. we are the temple of the living god and need to call evil out.god bless you and all.
i wasn t there  however  i have been told the founding fathers were secular and provided a secular constitution.  over the years there have been a lot of atrocities in the name of religion and they continue to occur.  there seems to be ample evidence hitler started life as a roman catholic and spoke against atheism.   later in his life he still considered himself christian.  stalin and lenin had nuanced views regarding religion.
god speaks to everyone  there are 3 voices we hear and that is everyone.  1. god 2. devil 3. yourself one just has to figure out which one hear.
i believe it s only dying more to the world. many including i are on fire and many are still bring saved.
john adams said that   our constitution was written for a moral and a religious people. it is wholly inadequate for any other.
when the body of christ has to leave their church because of compromise and false doctrine  we know it s as bad as it can get.
explain please!
agreed! many of them were part of the grift  in my area it was said the bishops were paid off to keep the churches closed. it s all about the money for them! realized this many years ago when so many churches were closing or merging. my own for instance  and for years my family and the other patrons supported them through the necessary collections  for upkeep for  improvements for years. all to be sold  it s now a senior center as we speak.
i did not know why i kept being drawn away from a physical building of what is called church  until i was alone with christ one day and he said i will teach you truth. since then i have learned more biblical truth   leaning not to man s understanding  but to god s understanding. we each have a place in our lords kingdom  mine is to learn then teach through the holy spirit my family and people god brings my way. and if you think you cannot be of need for christ and sharing of the gospel  then here i am a disabled great grandmother  that cannot walk  has congestive heart failure  plus many other diseases  some i was born with sharing god s message of salvation to others that want a true relationship with jesus christ  as john 10 27 states. i ve seen what god can do  because i was there. i ve seen people come to christ that were so evil you would think they would never get saved by the blood of jesus. so i pray for our leaders  that they come to know jesus christ as their savior and live the life of following him. prayer works and if we all  that know christ and walk with him daily  will pray the same  then our prayers can be answered. if a person chooses to deny christ then god gives them a reprobate mind. kind of like what we are seeing now all over  even in our gov. may god bless us that hold fast to his faith.
@brenda bowers  amen sister. i too am disabled yet that doesn t stop me from sharing the love of jesus to other s.yes  prayer works and i am praying for you for a total healing in jesus name. i firmly believe there are more of us then the evil one s. through the shed blood of jesus we have the authority to rebuke all evil spirit s including satan himself. god bless you brenda.
@esther s daughter! long  amen to all you said! i will say a healing prayer for you as well  sister! wanted to add we both subscribe to dr  berg
i am a nerd of eschatology.  and from what i have learned about what is to come  we do not have decades before countries like the usa fall.  we have years. . . and it is going to get much worse very quickly.maranatha!
most american christianity has become like the laodicean church. too comfortable  neutral  lukewarm.  i know thy works  that thou art neither cold nor hot  i would thou wert cold or hot. so then because thou art lukewarm  and neither cold nor hot  i will spue thee out of my mouth.   revelation 3 15 16
we are still doing much better here in the usa compared to europe where all the church s are empty.thr founding fathers said our constitution would not last without virtuous citizens!  virtue is long gone!
the church is dying because people uncluding myself since i was a kid are tired of waiting for jesus return. the world has gotten worse since then and i m already 50 yrs old. i guess if he does come  it won t be in my life time. like that one song goes..... give me something to believe in
my husband and i have stopped going to church but watch online a couple of preachers. occasionally we watch our own church but have seen in the past few years that all he wants to speak about is tithing which he doesn t teach the actual teachings of the bible. takes cruises every year imagine that
the church has become bad  unwelcoming  only wants certain types of people.  i have been asked to leave 2 churches.  one  because my child had early trauma he needed to share.  two  we didn t have enough financial stature.  the last straw was how the women made fun of my new haircut  i cut it myself.    i ll not go back and i m very hurt.  nether situation was handled in a christian way.
i m a scriptual believer  but all the churches i have been to  preach their own thing for their own benefit.  independent study  and questioning things is not so much encouraged.  truth stands to questioning.  intentional mistranslation drives people away into agnosticism when people rationalize churchianity.
a christian renaissance is the only thing that can save our western civilization  but i don t know if it will be possible. we live in dark times.
don t have to watch this to figure out what you may say! so here goes let s talk and agree with you dear p. nurse.
the overall reasoning these bad things are happening is because the people sit by and allow it. the highest authority in the land is not the president  it is the people. and the people have become so entitled to their lives and possessions  so lazy to even stand up  and too cowardly to take control  that evil is capitalizing on it.as much as i hate it for the few innocent people out there  i have to agree with my dad   if the people are too sorry to stop it then they deserve what they get. people  if you want freedom  you re gonna have to stand up. and i m afraid we have let these evil greedy people build up so big now  and they don t want to give up nor lose their power and wealth  that we will have to do what george washington had to do. an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  or so they say. it ll probably take one thousand pounds of cure now. the price of laziness and cowardice.
the iron is growing  and the clay is shrinking.
jesus is coming soon.
the  church  may be crumbling   but there are still plenty of people who believe that jesus christ is the son of god.  churches have gotten away from teaching about the word of god.  god bless
all inclusive means nothing is evil. this increases the coffers. add in paying little to no taxes and it is the ultimate recipe for greed over morals any day.
kalispell!  i have some folks that might be interested in that.
the lord jesus christ is our only hope. may we know him and make him known.
when a god appears in front of me  that s when i m going to start going to church. fyi i am not holding my breath waiting for that to happen and you shouldn t either.
once the mega churches with those like olsteen became a thing  the church lost its way. greed is a powerfully sinful energy.
the true church will never die. the institutional churches in america largely died long ago  when the ministers and seminary professors began to teach and preach that the bible was not the inerrant word of god  but was instead open to individual interpretations. that removed the standard  and the rise of universalism  the belief that everyone will go to heaven  made the institutional church largely irrelevant.
amen... truth
years    maybe months  maybe weeks. the question isn t  how long til he returns  but how soon.even so  come quickly lord jesus. ! !
amen!. watch  pray     biblically  occupy  with whatever gift s    talent s  he  has given unto you
@mike dickison  yes  years  we have not yet entered the  70th week of daniel  yet.  so that means we have more than 7 years before he returns.  and that 7 year period doesn t start until the temple is rebuilt...
@ian fults  chapter and verse that clearly teaches anything except a great falling away has to happen before he returns.
that s just it  just like going to your job and people back biting each other. i worked with church going people  some of them were very miserable people always complaining always litigating church doctrine.
@alan rice  i did make a good friend  or so i thought  at church.  as soon as she started donating large sums of money  the very people laughing at me took her into the fold and she ditched me.  i consider myself a strong person  but it hurt.  i really wanted my child to learn and be with a good youth group.  i teach him as best i can.
@deepwaters333  because people are in church doesn t make them any better of a person  in some cases i believe it brings out the worse  i ve seen first hand people treat people like crap and hide behind this i m christian so i m forgiven. these kind of people are fake. sorry that happened to you when you were there for the right reasons.
@alan rice  thank you for the kind words mr. rice  smiles.
unfortunately you still have to have the anti-christ before the second coming.
there is a variance in  of  view s  @ this point  interpretation of any number of scriptures seems why......
let s be honest the founding fathers where also heavy into secularism and liberalism. after all the world they grew up in was during the height of the enlightenment era and some of the founding fathers and many intellectuals at that time where either actual believing christian s or just rational deists  . but i believe all of them believed in the enlightenment ideals and wished the united states to be in a post christian society. where most people are more rationale  scientifically literate  more atheistic and technologically advanced.i m a believer too but we shouldn t ignore how huge the scientific revolution and the enlightenment era was and still is too this day. i m gonna be honest christianity during the middle ages gave europe such ptsd through its constant religious wars  witch hunts etc. so unfortunately or fortunately to many people christianity shot itself in the arrow and birthed secularism  liberalism and the enlightenment era haha
great vid  praise the father
revelation 3  church of laodicea  is the final  church addressed before the lord comes back.. but jesus says  be zealous and repent
our small parish has alot of people that take advantage of our food bank  and  thrift store but you won t see a one come to mass. sad
this lady is super smart. it s sad how demoralized we are quickly becoming.
i believe religion has failed humankind. there is no way the creator of this earth is going to allow puny humans to ruin it. his original purpose for this planet will come to be. this was refreshing! thank you.
when the foundation has been dissolved  the house will crumble. yeshua spoke of this diligently. thank you for sharing this video. the remnant has been observant. replacement theology has taught over time to focus on the new testament while disregarding the old testament. yah set a path very clearly defined in the torah for how we are to live. keep speaking about foundations and the abrahamic covenant! his people including those in the islamic faith can and do understand this along with the jewish people. the 2 branches have to become one  israel and jews  in order for yeshua to intervene. i pray you stand fast and strong to bringing people to the understanding of the torah. may his light be shed on your delivery!
you are right!
i always liked and admired the patriot nurse  but i have been confused for so long about her beliefs. i know she s jewish but i believe she loves and respects my lord and savior jesus christ also. i hope i m correct.
the week month after 9 11 church attendees went way the heck up.
satan has overtaken the churches and they bow to the state for greed
the second coming of christ is to all men not just one. i believe this happens when mankind chooses to recognized what jesus said   praise not the messenger but for the message.  this will happen when people chose the faith of jesus not the faith in jesus. jesus was not christian he was an essene.
the axe is already at the root of the trees. therefore  every tree that doesn t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.  mat 3 10 cultural christianity is a forest of these trees.
thanks!
the church is not dying. the church cannot die. the church is being made ready for the harvest.when that harvest happens  there will be left an empty shell of what the church was.the wheat will be gathered into the barn and the chaff will be gathered to be burned.
patriot nurse for president !
the church is dying but will not die
i don t believe jesus  church is dying. satan is attacking it harder as his rein is getting close to being blocked for a thousand years. but if you live as jesus said to and keep his commandments you will have no worries in your end. all those who fail will be judged accordingly.
pretty hard to accept that people are realizing that god was made up to explain the world and how hard life can be. i get it. but it ll be ok folks. you can be moral and good without spaghetti monster  i promise.
@thepatriotnurse  i think the lord for everything you do. god has called you for such a time is this. god bless you sister
asbury revival may say different.  let s give thanks    for god is our redeemer!  them bad ppl are in big trouble!
well  at least they re being helped and blessed on way.
since covid we have been transformed by the renewing of our minds and revelation of the old and new testament through the teachings of  truthunedited  on youtube. we are stronger and grounded in yahweh as never before. blessings to all  no weapon formed against us shall prosper. yah has us   there is no other hope.
i left the church years ago. i see no use for them. they don  even teach it right.
the church is a live and well.  just the fence sitters are leaving
they keep building mega-churches in texas.  they re nothing more than a business  in my opinion.  i don t believe that pastors should be living in a mansion or driving expensive vehicles.  if you are called to lead  your mission should be to teach and help others.  christians that i personally know  give god a bad name.  either way  we can all do better and it begins with us.
this is why embracing torah is so important in these last days.   i believe this passover could be the last chance to choose who we serve  in covenant  as a free people  because the programmable currency is end of freedom and likely the mark of the beast coupled with vaccine passport requirements.the churches teaching the law was done away with  and the establishment of public schools and tv was the beginning of the end for america.   the cold war and industrial revolution combined to bring about the explosion increase of technology  which allows for enslavement.   torah functions as the rod and staff of psalm 23 4  the tools of a shepherd  the bible .
the body of christ is alive and well! revival is here. non believers and believers alike who were suffering during the plandemic were compelled to find a church  and are seeking the peace that surpasses all understanding - jesus! lukewarm institutions like the methodist church are falling by the wayside but the word is here and alive!!
it is on life support.  in britain too.
the true church is gods choosing and it is right where is is supposed to be.
the number of closed abandoned churches will  be astounding in the next 10 years. most mainline denominations have been compromised in an effort to accommodate the world. no  this is not where you go to assemble with saints. these places are under judgement and about to be history..
every father should know and learn theology and if need be can lead a church in his home as the puritans did.
there is a reason there is only a stairway to heaven  and a highway to hell. hell is expecting high amounts of traffic.
please read the book return of the gods by rabbi jonathan cahn.thank you for spreading the truth!!
the church is shrinking  not dying. the dross is being melted away  and the rest are whom jesus will return for.
if the foundations be destroyed  what can the righteous do   - psalms 11 3   indeed  all who desire to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted.  - 2 timothy 3 12the foundations are being destroyed  and bible believing people of faith will be persecuted.
there are many surveys out that support what you are saying. what troubling  there has been a steady decline of christians do not read their bible outside of church on a regular basis. less than 11 . there is an estimate of 33 000  christian denominations in the world today  all say that they preach what yhwh said. someone is wrong. maybe  we need to be reading our bible and see what he said and test everything including what we believe to what he said.
thank you sis3
the true church is fine...it was never very large but still walks in power the power to reconcile people back to god! this won t be found in religious denominations! rev. 3 7-13.
amen
body of christ is alive and well! revival is here  so where is he
the wheat from the chaff
i stopped going to church because the people in the church were not following the word or showing christian values. too much hypocrisy and people who thought  they  were the perfect saved individuals regardless of their actions the other six days a week. i hope the church is changing to be true followers of christ and the bible.
@katherine brodie  . i haven t been to a church building in years. and yes people are the problem. it is from both the political right and left.
@katherine brodie  same here!  i agree 100 .  you may enjoy a youtube channel called born again barbarian.
it is dying based in on her definition.
i see the  woke  culture actually causing an  awakening  in christianity.....
the gospel is dying or shrinking what ever you choose to call it because of people using excuses that they stopped going to church because of the hypocrites because they get self centered or lazy. you go and be the best and serve others for god and for your own salvation. we are all hypocrites at times. we wouldn t need church if we were all perfect. i go to church to stay focused and reminded of what my life here on earth is all about.  if we were perfect it would mean we had no free agency. the scriptures are a guide to help us to return to our father in heaven s presence.
@nola borrego  the word says not to even eat with those kind. ministry leaders who post selfies on instagram all week long then give a show on sunday mornings.
@jerome 1949  i think so too!
john adams was definitely correct. we recognize no sovereign but god  and no king but jesus!  u.s. founder
the dying church is prophesied for the end times. it s separation time between those who d rather be goats vs those that want to be sheep. only a remnant of believers make it to heaven due to believing  obeying out of love and having an intimate relationship with the lord  who said all 3 are required to get to heaven.those that do works out of rote or wanting to be seen and not out of love and an intimate relationship with the lord simply don t make it to heaven.
teshuvah! turn back to the holy one of yisra el  the god of avraham  the god of yitzhak and the god of yaakov.  we absolutely must keep the torah. have synagogue at home with other torah observant congregants  family members  and friends. baruch hashem!

without scripture and christ in our heart we are but a hollow shell of a person and not the spirit filled child of god for which we have been created.
got your message but telegram says my phone is banned. i wonder what is a bigger deal you are ausome as it is my dear patriot nurse
our constitutional republic ended. november 6 1860
it is a well established truth that very good people can be non believers or believers.  however history does unequivocally show that religious passions have not been at all good for humanity.
it s called the end times.  it is prophecy being fulfilled.  you cannot stop it.  it is the great falling away from christ.  you can love your neighbor and share that jesus chris is the way  the truth and the life.  our job is to share the gospel.  but know this  the scripture tells us that the path is narrow and the love of people will grow cold. for those of us who love christ  we are foreigners here on earth as we yearn for our heavenly home.what will end this for those of us who believe that jesus is the son of god and accept him as our savior  is his return to take us home.  then  truly  those left will see an evil never seen on this earth with the rise of the antichrist.
good people steeple are waking -up!
i was raised catholic  but as soon as i started reading the word  i knew it was counterfeit. i don t see how anyone who reads the bible can remain catholic.
you are pretty
i became a devout christian but i have not set foot in church nor do i believe in the robotic process of church based  worship
the church  or whatever you want to call it has always been on the wide   broad path.  it has never been on the narrow   set-a-part path!  it has always confused men s doctrine with the will of god.
i stopped going because it seemed like the church was more focused on getting new people and asking for money.
2 thessalonians 2 3. let no man deceive you. that day  of the lords return  will not come until there s a great falling away and the man of sin is revealed. the falling away has begun with covid. people were afraid to get out and go to church. persecution is coming and there will be a greater falling away. the lord will separate the wheat from the tares. romans 10 9 if you will confess with your mouth that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you shall be saved. repent and believe the gospel mark 1 15. begin reading your bible and ask god to lead you to a true bible believing church and he will. wanda
passivity is this generation s sin and will be our curse.
hitler. stalin. pol pot. castro. thank you  charles darwin. thank you  margaret sanger. thank you  evolutionists. you all have the blood of millions on your hands.
depends on who you are talking the true church is. not the apostate church. not the tares. the true church are the people that walk tight with the lord jesus who cling to him and his word. not ones who belong to churches  sit in the seats and hear but aren t obedient. nope we re not those. by their fruit you will know who they are pretty much. they are the ones who have been rescued out of this world and live in the kingdom of christ in the spirit.


i d say broadway baptist church in memphis is a good one
what of the asbury revival
you are awesome and i wish you were coming to west tn or west kentucky
thank you  for confirming  my belief.
i ve written an essay on what the bible actually says about our responsibility to the government. it s not what most christians are being taught. i wrote it because i ve been taught wrong my whole life. contact me if you are interested.
sports are our new god everyone feels like their children have to be in a sport so they can go to awoke college all sports play on sunday now so unfortunately there is no time for church
people think the war is coming  one between the people of the book and those that despise it. christians on a whole  have no idea of spiritual warfare. they think the fight was over with a simple prayer of repentance. all that did was made them a target. there is a whole lot more to it then that.
jesus prayed that they may all be one with a visible head  peter. not 50 000 competing cults that believe they got it right.
the world is everything god said it would be in the book of revelation.
russia has a strong christian population  and their government is closely connected to the orthodox church. there are laws in russia protecting the church from ridicule  slander or disrespect . the orthodox church does not and never has altered it s beliefs or practices to pander to the modern world.   just saying.
church means called out ones  dead bride dead church... faithful believers will meet in groups of two or three in their homes@grow from  there seeking god s will. god will provide all our needs according to his riches@glory in jesus christ. god bless.
it  s been said that the lord godadds by subtracting multiplies by dividing.an example is gideon.
the  return of jesus is not far away  god is looking for his bible practicing people  that includes the 4th commandment about gods 7th day sabbath. we need to be keeping all of gods law. if we don t want to keep gods law here on earth then we wouldn t be happy in heaven as gods law will be kept in heaven. don t worry about this old world as god will be making us a brand new one. with bible keeping people to live in it forever
super !
there are multiple reasons why the church especially the christian church is dying. 1 is a great awaking  people are seeing the lies of christianity with the preacher s who tickle the ears and preach the prosperity gospel  who seem to put more money into lavish and luxurious personal lifestyles then they do the community s. they collect so much money to go on missionary all over the world while they ignore those in their own backyards. their are so many others who truly love our father and our messiah  that once they realized they have been tricked into satan worship the forsake the lies and find the torah instead. we have been lied to and deceived so greatly that once god opened our eye s we chose not to have anything to do with these false places of worship.  christmas  easter  valentines day  halloween  all of it is pagan and we we re told it s ok because we christianize it. this is what we believed until a proper teacher came and reminded us of the book of exodus and how yah felt about the golden calf worship. what s even more horrific is what these pagan holidays entailed in ancient times  ritualistic human and child sacrifice to demons.. christians love the 10 commandments just not the second and fourth commandment. the sabbath is important to our most our creator  yet we forsake the sabbath to worship on sunday the day of the sun god ra. yahuah commandments apply to everyone that wants to be part of the new jerusalem  yet we forsake the words of our messiah in matthew 5 17 to listen to paul who says we re saved by grace and not works. even though paul reiterated that a few verses later. in conclusion this is why the church is dying. christians don t worship yahuah on the sabbath  they don t obey yahuah and yahushas teachings  they set their church on sand not stone  they worship god on any holiday as long as it s not the actual feast and celebrations days of our creator and our messiah. and now we re incorporating lgbt into the church. so to the rest of the world we look like lies and hippocrites.
hello  beautiful lady yes thing are sad when it co!e to church so sad
it is interesting how the christian religion is prospering in africa  and parts of the middle east.maybe they have taken the baton for the christian destiny
the war has been with us from the garden.
we are the church. we are the temple of the holy spirit. if you are stuck in organized religion  please consider reading and praying for yourself. find a group of like minded believers  and learn to worship the lord for yourself. your  church  cannot save you  we must have a personal relationship with jesus. it s up to you.
we are already in the time you describe.
the churches have failed to preach the true message of jesus christ and a deep relationship with him and the true power of the holy spirit and our church leaders not walking with jesus as the should
i am subscribed   notifications turned on..however i never get any notifications that you have put out a new video    doesn t happen wirh others i subscribe to...mmmmmm...god bless you   your family.
i work as a social worker in nebraska and i work a lot with gen z and alpha. what they have told me is that they feel like the church s in the us just don t reach out to their generation at all. now obviously  the never ending problem of church doctrine never changing going up against a society and culture that is constantly changing comes into play here. that being said  the youth i work with see church as yet another means of division between people  hence why they don t feel compelled at all to attend. and even if you wanted to  which of the 30 000 denominations is the  true church    many of the modern church s have also jumped neck deep into the political sphere which also pushes many youth away. you might shrug your shoulders and say  so what  at all of this  but the baby boomers are the largest current church members  and they are quickly dying off. they will be replaced with gen x and the millennials very soon and both of those generations  by in large  are nowhere near as traditional as the baby boomers  whom themselves were far less traditional than  the greatest generation .  i m not sure what there really can be done to circumvent this problem to be honest  but that is what i m seeing on a consistent basis.
too many  pastors   are more concerned with filling their mega churches than preaching the word of god.
my cowboy church in texas is growing more young family s and lots of kids .e texas
the bible chronicles the ages. each age a new god. this age ends and pisces goes with it. the next age is the age of truth and we know the truth is ugly.
this girl is so awesome
god is not into religion whatsoever  those that try and connect with him by actions  works of the flesh  .rather  he s already connected with mankind by gifting us with his son and by believing in his redemptive act we reconnect with god  relationship with god is thus restored . hallelujah and amen!!
the church is built on christ. not religion. the church of jesus christ shall never perish.  but  i understand what she s saying. all in accordance with the will of god. absolutely imperative to study god s word i agree!!!
shepherds chapel in gravette  arkansas teaches the bible chapter by chapter and verse by verse. we should follow the word of god not traditions of men.
not decades  likely not even years  possibly months.
the constitution is for moral and intelligent people  it is not dependent on believing in the bible. i speak as a person who was a christian for 60 years and i am a better and happier person since moving on from it. take a deep breath  give people more credit for having the desire for a cohesive  caring  law-abiding society.
the church is dying because it has rejected its god by rejecting his pure inerrant word  the king james bible. it has replaced truth with comforting words that are uninspired and backward.
2 timothy 3 2 comes to mind
so... if storytelling and belief in story create the cooperation necessary for society  then you can call us a christian society. weaknesses within the society are weaknesses in the story.... so then  given our current circumstances  namely this ongoing sexual  epidemic specifically.... you might say societies greatest weakness is that it worships virgins. the fact that jesus never had sex might actually be our greatest weakness. and because of this... and the fact that church is separate from state  the sexual epidemic is bound to become more represented in government than the churches. if testosterone continues to drop  i d expect the churches to decay from the inside out. as technology exacerbates this  i d say the churches are doomed.
hello  from henderson nv
look at the history of the roman catholic church. one world religion. read revelation. it s right there. pagan holidays and keeping the sabbath day holy. that meaning saturday.
thank you for sharing this resource  eagerly checking it out now -god bless
it s also an easy way to predict the extremification of the churches
religion is dying my dear lady! not yah s body of believers. the true church of yahusha hamashiach is thriving. we are the church of the most high! we are that living and breathing temple. yah s people are living and thriving all over this world.these truly are exciting times in history! i ve never in all the days of my life seen yah forsake the righteous. never!i must share my unique experience that happened today.today i was at aldi shopping. i checked out and was walking to my car. as i approached my car a car backed out and didn t see me. i was right behind it to get to my car pushing a buggy. i don t know how i got to other side to safety. yah s angels supernaturally protected me. the man was shocked when he quickly realized he could have killed me.he dropped his head in his hands and begged for forgiveness. i told him i wasn t mad at him. i forgive him. i told him that someone loved both him and me. that my life could have ended. yah had his hands on my life! i praise his holy name from the depths of my soul!
it s a sad commentary when you have to get a sound theological grounding on youtube. i heard a catholic priest say last night that homosexual unions were an improvement on the promiscuity of the 1980s.
absolutely incorrect! christ s  church  does not  will not  and cannot die! christ s church is being perfected unto himself  as  it will be without spot or blemish.  the local assembly is no doubt dead. the local  assembly  is a local church  or assembly  but not the church of god in christ. the problem   my people perish for lack of knowledge.   ever learning  but never able to come to the knowledge of the rtuth.   the blind leading the blind  and they all fall into the ditch.  god s church is alive  well  beautiful and thriving! how sad you don t know that.
if you haven t read solzhenitsyn...you don t know history
the reason churches are dying are that too many clergy preach the word of man  not the word of god. sermons should be completely based on gospel and not summer camps or cookie sales. if churches would get back to the word of god  the people would flock back and the churches would be alive again
jesus would have taken the clot shot  franklin graham
i watch pastor charles larson from tennessee on youtube. he is one of the few who i know of  who preaches and teaches 100  kjv scripture
hello from va.!!
jesus
you need to read your bible. certain establishments may be becoming stagnant but the scripture is clear  gods  church will be greater in the later rain then the former rain. again i suggest you read your bible about  gods  church. i think with all the goings on your thinking is side tracked. this is the greatest hour for the church  as clearly stated in the bible. read the word. i myself have been seeing miracles  god pouring out his spirit and moving mightily in the midst of his people and it will increase  the word declares it!again read your bible and ask god open your eyes. one last thought is if you believe the church is failing then in your mind god must not be strong enough and your faith lies in people not god jesus reins supreme  he is the alpha and omega  the first and the last  the beginning and the end  the great i am - the almighty god! in whom shall i fear!  i believe in you jesus!he numbers the sparrows and has named each one  and the stars in heaven. he has numbered the hairs of my head. i am more valuable to him then all of these and he will take care of me!
can you speak at a conference  i can get you in touch but its a group you may not be used too
when god s word is neglected for something that is  easier to understand  then you no longer have god s word  without god s word there is no power.the kjv is the word of god  and everything else is the words of men.
i am an earth angel. jesus was a messenger like all of us. he is god like all of us. dont be religious  be spiritually awakened
one solution  watch  the chosen
a
just love the bill gates ads.

despicable.  shameful. he s  wrong.
good ol franklin.
amen! we watch most services on line. lawson preaches the truth  although i don t believe in the once saved always saved! he is the best on youtube. we  also  found goodfightministries on youtube and just love their channel to educate ourselves!
@janet pursel awesome i ll check them out. i attend destiny church in rocklin ca they also keep it very real and it s a big church. you have a blessed day.
king james version of the bible has only existed for about 500 years and threw out seven books that were part of the canon since the 300s  that mr. luther did not agree with
i ve been watching pastor lawson for many yrs
interesting. i see that there is a reply to my comment  but i can t see that reply
the bible was not written in kj english. or any english  since english did not even exist at the time. nor do  legititmate  bible translators translate from the kjv into modern english. that is not  how it s done. they go back to the original languages  which were hebrew  greek  and a bit of aramaic. please stop spewing such ignorance. thank you.
@yesica1993  the problem with this is a lack of understanding what god can do and has done. the word  translate  in the bible is always taking from a lesser state to a greater  but only in the kjv. lastly  because text kinda stinks to read for too long  if there is a single flaw  error  missing word  contradiction  etc.  it cannot be the word of god. for over 400 years now people have tried  but cannot find one in the king james.
@bayview i have no idea how this response addresses what i said in my other comment. or even how it pertains to your original comment. again  proper translators go back to the original hebrew   greek. it s no different than translating the bible into another language besides english. if you re translating the bible into spanish or german or whatever other language  you don t start with that english bible. you go back to the hebrew   greek and translate that into spanish  german  whatever language. that is the proper way to do it  to make sure things are as accurate as possible. this is not my opinion or idea. this is just factually true. that s why you not only didn t address my original comment stating this same thing  you know you cannot address it. again  it is factually true. none of this has anything to do with the content of pn s video. you have wasted enough of my time with this. goodbye.
test everything with the word.
come jesus.  come yeshua  jesus !
good video
immediate share on twitter
i think i remember stories in the bible of jesus overturning tables on the church h grounds of his time. there is a difference between the body of god in our time  meaning his image  and that being us  vs. the nonprofit corporation established under man s laws people refer to as the church. what is the church  i believe simply  when two or more are gathered in his name there god shall be also  and that is the church. now why are these institutions in our society we refer to as churches dying  should they  maybe two or more of us get together and ponder it we may find we could be looking at the wrong  church .
because all that is in the world   the lust of the flesh  the lust of the eyes  and the pride of life   is not of the father but is of the world. 1 john 2 16 isn t that the essence of jealousy  lust of the eyes   lust of the flesh  physical lust  and the pride of life  pursuit for glory  we re already there!
is the pope catholic!  nope!
church  building of meeting  and church  followers of jesus  are dying falling away. the remnant is what will remain. for if the very elect can be deceived.......stand firm.  in joy
jealousy lust greed  oh oh guess i m out. those are my good points.

welcome to the republic nation of texas ....
you are one beautiful woman. the so called church has been dead for awhile. the holy spirit is not in those places.  sad those places have people not there to have salvation. but to pray to the god of this world. not seek the blood of the lord jesus christ.
can you give  a reference or footnote to the paassage quoted at 5 20 so i can read it.  mishna

hello from wnc.
the next thing to occur is romans 8 19. they will proclaim inerrant kingdom doctrine to the elect so they may obtain their white robes.
the church is not dying in my united states. i see more ad more people coming to jesus all the time.. i do see an apostate church but i see many many new believers. god knows what he s doing.
i study eschatology and bible prophecy is popping off the pages  ppl better get right with  yeshua hamashiach
yes  correct  as is said in 1 john 2 16 - all that is in the world  lust of the flesh  lust of the eyes  pride of life  is not of the father...buckle up saints...!
as per the prophets and revelation    flee from babylon lest ye suffer her plagues!    call no man on earth  father   or rabbi  teacher  pastor  elder  shepherd  priest  founder  etc.     they installed kings  but not by his will  by vote     be ye not like the nations around thee .  see also psalm 146 and 1 samuel chapter 5.  jesus lives!!!!!
jesus christ is the answer ! .    so many have no respect or morals never have hade god in their lives . pray ask for forgiveness and guidance and  look the lord god almighty for guidance and mercy .   turn away from this evil in this country !!
they can t kill the church in me regardless of the evil powers which god has put in charge  not the humans god created in the likeness of him  this will all be sorted out so remember where your destiny lies!
yes it is sad what is happening in america. but  we are in the end times. i am not concerned about the future of my children as much as i am concerned that they are ready to meet jesus. the near future is jesus putting an end to sin in this world and taking his children home.
true
i was listening to paul harvey  if i were the devil and freedom to chains.

most so called christians haven t a clue when and how to treat god s sabbath day
does she mention jesus once in this video
much of what is killing the church in america is also the churches themselves  and more specifically the pastors and leaders of the churches. many pastors are more concerned about worldly things and appearances first  and after that dedicate varying amounts of time to being a shepherd to their flock. four years ago i left the church where i had been an active member for 24-25 years. many things led to me to stop being a part of that church. i was falsely accused of some petty stuff  not anything sexual or anything like that  and it was handled just as wrongly as it could be. even though how to attempt to resolve the issue was being held forth  matthew 18 15-20  the church itself was not exactly following these rules. other contributing factors included a pastor who will not meet with anyone from the congregation  he claims that he is to shy and introverted to meet with people  but really the problem is something else . he leaves day to day operations and any counseling needs to his staff. this practice allowed a fair amount of inconsistency and abuse of their positions of power. this same pastor also would not perform weddings or funerals  except for very close personal friends. much of that pastor s teaching were became repetitious and followed the same teaching plan that he had developed at one time  to the point that long time members could tell you what he would say teach next  and how many sundays he would spend on this particular lesson. even more egregious was that we often head from the pulpit about how this pastor  and his church  believe and follow only what the bible says and teaches. yet hypocrisy and inconsistencies were becoming steadily more rampant. so basically a very dysfunctional church. the pain and anger from what i went thru there left me bitter for a while.and the church that i left previously to finding that last church  was also dysfunctional and suddenly  imploded   it just closed their doors on fairly short notice. so having survived 2 dysfunctional churches has left me a little hesitant  to try this again.i have to confess that i haven t been inside of a church since leaving that one  but have learned that you don t need to be a member of a church to live a christian and godly life. i read my bible  though i do need o read it more often  and i am very christian in my day to day life and how i treat interact with the world. i will admit that i miss the fellowship of being around other christians  and i am starting to feel moved to try and find new churches and see if i can find a new church home. not saying that the issues that you talked about pn were not valid at all. i think that societal issues at large are also playing a role in the church becoming less of an institution than it was even 20 years ago. the world is changing  of that there is no doubt  and it is not changing for the better. just wanted to say that the church today is not helping itself either  and they really need to take a deep hard look at it s own house as well as where society is going in general.
the population will split up into tribes
yea now they all have pride flags out front and preach  love  like they missed the other 80  of the bible
it happened once before with israel - see solomon.
fear god and dreadnought.
i think it s all where you look  check out the quite frankly show podcast...
believe me not all churches are dying
maranatha lord jesus
the churches must collapse because they are the works ways  of the adversary. they do contain some of the truth  but as we have been warned mat. 23 13  but woe  judgment is coming  to you   scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  because you shut off  eternal life to the people  for you do not gain yourselves  nor do you allow those who are  in the process of  seeking to do so.
the  institutional church  is dying!  james 4 4 says   you adulterous people  don t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against god  therefore  anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god.   the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers  so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of christ  who is the image of god.  2 corinthians 4 4.  this is a spiritual battle!  too many so called christians have allowed the delusions of this evil world to enter their hearts.  the antichrist spirit is being revealed.  it is preceding the coming of the physical appearance of the antichrist  the man of lawlessness who will take the place of god in the temple and demand all to worship him!  it is time to repent and return to our first love!  thank you patriot nurse for helping to sound the alarm!  you are truly a watchman  woman !
tyranny can not have any control over a people who do not live in this world but in the kingdom of yahweh a spiritual life as did our lord jesus  and savior .

reading what you shared. my family recently began attending an old fashioned independent fundamentalist baptist church. after being hurt and even led astray in modern dysfunctional churches  to be in a bible believing church is a tremendous blessing. our faith and our family is flourishing. our church has never compromised to this modern culture and stands firmly on the king james bible. god designed us to be in community  so the desire you have to be in one is from him.   praying god leads you to a solid church where you will be blessed and be a blessing.
@lala  the last church stated frequently that they were based in what the bible said  that  the words of the bible would always be how they would conduct themselves  and how they would guide this church . yet with time i started to see more and more that was not the case. had one assistant pastor tell me that wasn t bound by these rules  they didn t apply to him. so my beliefs in pastors as church leaders had taken some pretty good hits there. about two years ago the head pastor announced that he was going to take a one year sabbatical from his work as a pastor to pray and see what he should do next. someone else continued to lead the church  and though this shake up caused people to start leaving that church  membership was probably around 1 000-1 200 . perhaps about 8 months later the other head pastor told the church that he was going to sell the building. i know that there are now perhaps 50-100 members remaining  and they are meeting in another location  last that i heard.it was obviously time for me to leave that church  and that decision was something that i had placed before the spirit to release me from there  which he did  and also to bring me back to church when he  the holy spirit  and i were ready. i had a lot of anger and pain to deal with  so maybe it is time for me to find a new church home.
just look how they hid the truth of the way  in deception called a commandment    do not covet . it means not to take authority dominion rulership  that we are created as equals to each other and eventually to the creator. what the sermon on the mount is telling us  the humble are those that do not take dominion.
i m sorry mr. franklin  seems we could not keep the republic.
there is no remission of sin without faith in the blood of the lord jesus christ ! romans c3 v 22-28 kjv

all done on purpose  our graduates can t tell you how many star are on the flag the 1st president or run 50 yards.
the church is only a medium to bring you together. the church of rome done some things  made some decissions that allowed abominations. that  church   is no longer speaking a god s rule...
in the last day s knowledge will be abundant  it s quite clear that people still follow that old narrative. why you ask  they re still on yew boob
shalom!
church may be dead.. but believers still believe.. you can take the church away you can never take jesus away..
there is a remnant.
church dying    i think not.  it is a sifting long overdue .  we must smelt the iron to ensure its strength.
nice menorah in the background.
i wish n pray you are wrong  but i feel you are correct. lord jesus  help us.
sorry love  but the institution died decades ago!!!yes  there will always be a remnant  but the people who lived it   breathed it are fading from memory and or dying  leaving too few to run a godly  trustworthy society with.
the kingdom of yahuah has suffered violence! and the violent will take it back by force!  matthew 11 12
i am a  christian  that keeps torah.  i left the  church  in 2016 after actually studying the bible and realising that the  church  was lying about ...well  just about everything.  i keep the commandments of the father and the testimony of my messiah  yahusha...full stop.come out of her my people!
yea  the lord  even jesus  whose coming is not until after there cometh a falling away  by the working of satan with all power  and signs and lying wonders

not all churches are dying and you guys need to rethink what you put out there.  my church is growing by leaps and bounds.  adding on more sunday school classes rooms  splitting up study groups bc they are getting too big.  mine is not the only church.  there are quite a few around where i live that are also growing.  i cannot relate to your message at all.  not sure why you guys focus on the negative instead of showing the churches that are growing!!!
shema
didn t god tell us the church would be corrupted.
so you keep all 600 laws of leviticus
@femalekcroyalsfan  are you referring to the 613 mitzvoth enumerated by moses ben maimon in the 12th century
@femalekcroyalsfan  i keep all that apply to me.  all 613 laws are not for everyone.  there are laws for women  laws for men  ceremonial laws  which can t be don e as there is no temple  and laws for priests.  they are not hard. read your bible  torah is for those that love yah and are for ever  throughout our generations.  the point of my comment was not to get into a theological argument.  it is to state my faith.
@montana goose  no  i am not referring to talmud  i am referring to torah.
there s only one true church on the earth. that is the church of jesus christ of ladder day saints. the world is welcome to come and ask for forgiveness and be baptized and follow the teachings of jesus christ and strive for internal life which is the greatest gift of all
please see dr.steveturley  american muslims rise up  against woke  posted today
in my last comment i wrote  in bodily pleasure  and it should read  and not in bodily pleasure .   i am sick and writing is difficult. sorry.
no  souls  people  are dying in the united states. we worship self  money and possessions.
people who reject god s holy word  the commandments  are forced to create their own religion based on what they think is right.
yea.. we have some examples in the arab states for how good it is when states become run by religion.usa is one of those examples by the way.in general  the more religion  the more inhuman they become.its called fanatism.
solution is simple...read the bible and do what it says. unfortunately i think that things will get much worse before they get better.
church is just another business...people s careers are made off the blood of jesus...i ve seen more fellowship at a bar than i have at church
the bible says there will a falling away in the last days. come lord yeshua.
church died 40 years ago.
messianic
gab is one answer.
the church all around the world is dying just like the holy bible says it would. i would suggest everyone read romans chapter 1 in its entirety. it talks about the gay pride  evolution belief  and much more that s already been here for a while now. we are nearing the end period and people need to accept christ now!
because of our fallen nature god gave us scripture  10 commandments  and jesus. we cannot make it any other way. usa is falling away from god  and our hedge of protection is crumbling whilst many wallow in their vain secular pleasure.
i couldn t take going to church any more. all the sermons on prosperity pray and receive  pastors and preachers living lavish lifestyles jets fine cars mansions millions of dollars  towing the line on what they preach so the government doesn t take a there tax free fun status and big money.  fund me fund me is all i heard.  no guts no grit plan bs.  ugh   i am done
when you take away the god of abraham  a house divided can not stand. withiut the ten commandments  we have no base in good and evil on which to stand.
it s dying because the bible says before the rapture  there will be the great apostasy of the church. it s happening. the bible prophesy has never failed.
it is written  before  the pharisees   teachings  this ... ...just as the father exists in the proper sense  the one before whom there was no one else  and the one apart from whom there is no other unbegotten one  so too the son exists in the proper sense  the one before whom there was no other  and after whom no other son exists. therefore  he is a firstborn and an only son   firstborn  because no one exists before him and  only son  because no one is after him. furthermore  he has his fruit  that which is unknowable because of its surpassing greatness. yet he wanted it to be known  because of the riches of his sweetness. and he revealed the unexplainable power  and he combined with it the great abundance of his generosity.not only did the son exist from the beginning  but the church  too  existed from the beginning ...and it is also written... ...the pharisees   father  is a liar...  a murderer...from the  beginning   according to israel s book called genesis chapter 1 verse 1
persecution will prepared the bride for the coming bridegroom  but first what you speak of sound like tribulation.....
when 2 or more gather in my name. people are the church not a building. and if you don t believe in  jesus you will in the end.
gates of hell will not prevail against the true church of the lord. with all the bible perversions over the last 100 years  no wonders the departure of gods word has caused no faith. free will and self esteem is what i am hearing today.
the whole problem is you can t write a constitution such as ours has been written without being specific  on people  idealism  etc.  and be fair about it. the first amendment is basically one for basic freedoms of people  religion being one of them. it states that the government cannot make any laws for or against religion or prohibit is exercise. problem is  religion covers a lot of ground  even satanic worship is considered a religion  so despite the fact that christians see the word as their own  it s not. many of our founding fathers led a very bohemian lifestyle and were not exactly drenched in christianity. personally  it wouldn t hurt my feelings if they wiped organized religion off the face of the planet. your god is between you and him and has nothing to do with me. i mean religion has created more chaos  killings and hatred on the planet than anything else. these people suddenly feel they have been given the authority to command ways of living by a spooky figure in the sky. it s said he made man in a likeness of himself  so let s look at this. the christian faith almost went obsolete until a roman leader converted mostly for political reasons. this gave the christians the right to own the holy land so they felt. so  after they forced pagans to convert or die throughout the lands then went and killed thousands in crusades which they lost  then come to america  lied to and killed the natives here  and betrayed england that paid for the whole thing to get started  then enslaved people so they could get rich and not work. then they decide to steal the rest of the country from legions of people that had been living here for thousands of years  and when they realized they would not convert to their religion so they could control them  they slaughtered them in a genocide that actually gave hitler the idea for the final solution. more than 85  of americans today claim a faith  but dont live it. they like the bible to tap on it when others do things they don t like  as if it was a rulebook for all. its not. because our founding fathers said you had a right to worship christianity if you so choose  but nowhere does it say its everyone s way of life. if god made man in a likness of himself and his followers act like this  i want no part of following him or them....
false prophets are common today and common  people still pay tax to them .!
why did so few people enter the ark and everyone else perished why are so few people awake now and the vast majority heading to destruction read jeremiah 51. people and nations cross lines. it s the old question and point of debate ... did we choose him  or did he choose us shalom

the great falling away  christians should realize what time it is.
we are finished
where is the church when jesus takes 7 churches out of the midst of evil.
2 or more gather in his name there he is. do we really need churches as we know them to find jesus  thats a big fat no.
malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord  and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children  and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse. that is why we have temples.
you re not acknowledging the racial component to the downfall of america  its the biggest reason why we are where we are and we now face impending doom as a country
it is time for us to pick which side we are on either ritious or unritious but be warned if you pick ritious you will forfit your life savings and or possessions and eventually you will not be able to buy or sell. you will be black listed by the woke system of today that has been categorized as seriously flawed around 2000 years ago as they attack innocent children with a sexual agenda . the number of completeness is represented by the number 7 thus shortness of completeness or perfection is represented by 6 and a description of an abomination or serious flaw is by 6 three times which is 666 describing a controversial global demand that will be implemented by a beast  king nebuchadnezzar identified as feet of clay and iron or the anglo american world empire with the u.n. this i write is a quiet message spoken in a loud room that may save your life read your bible from cover to cover. it will give you peace that transcends all human understanding and will save your life many times i promiss! it will comfort you in your selection of ritiousness
many false prophets are out there! any religion that breaks deuteronomy 4 2 is false. his word stands forever.deuteronomy 4 2  esv   you shall not add to the word that i command you  nor take from it  that you may keep the commandments of the lord your god that i command you. whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. god bless!
wrong!people is dead!
we left   the christdom church about 7 years ago!   we have started a small home bible study. we are  studying the front of the bible because it for tells the 2nd testament.  the instruction are in the front of the bible pacifically in the 1st 5 books of your bible. it s an amazing what one was taught isn t what s within the bible. stop following tradition of men. but following what yhwh teaches and what  yeshua did he took the death penalty away from our sins. the commandment   torah are still in play. the tradition of men was nailed to the cross! not yhwh laws.  and read from the beginning to the end of your bible stop cherry picking your bible  it makes way more sense when you read it in its context! stay safe stay ready everyone!
god is dead  money is our god!

well you might want to remember that martin luther threw out seven books that he did not like. just saying.
@femalekcroyalsfan  i think most of christianity has thrown out laws that god said were forever. jesus kept them all and told us to follow him or we are not worthy of him. think about this please. god bless!
i stopped attending organized church because they abandoned the bible and god s word.

deu 4 6 keep therefore and do them   the 10 commandments  for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations  which shall hear all these statutes  and say  surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.because the church refuses to acknowledge sin  rejecting the 10 commandments  the church failed! people only want a saviour who know that they are sinners.the democrats know what made america great that is why they hate the phrase  make america great again !

sspx is not in retreat. catholic trads are taking ground.
jeremiah said that the clergy is responsible for the condition of the nation so it was in his time and so it is in our daythe founding fathers established this nation on the principle of   the rule of law! ... and that concept came from the bible moses and the ten commandmentsand that s what the clergy preached at the time of our founding fathers but not anymore.. and david sat upon the throne and executed justice and judgment among his people...so do you hear the modern church telling the leaders of america to execute justice and judgment.... and the answer is no
in god we trust. enough of us. btw lust  envy  greed  pride etc are not basic instincts but demonic corruption of natural desires.
the church is not dying.  the gates of hell will not prevail against her.  those assemblies who pretend to be christian but deny the power and the piety are failing big time.  the goats are being separated from the sheep.
we are at the end of the church age .  i m independent fundamental bible believing  babtist king james bible only.
god bless pn!

you ve conveniently left out the catholic church when talking of tyranny.

let s talk now i have something bigger to introduce  .......
lots of catholic hate in these comments.    we re on the same side.
not a church person. i think religion is under fire on purpose.
do you really think jesus is coming back for a dead bride   no! the church is not dead. what is dying is religion! holy spirit is moving on his people!! let god be god and i m going to think on things that are heavenly!! glory!!!
if god doesn t destroy us  he then would need to apologize to sodom and gomorrah.
i am sorry.maybe you missed a few things. i strongly disagree. maybe you are in the wrong place. i see a church that is rising.i see a church that is standing like never before. the word of god says when the enemy comes in like a flood .....he will raise a standard.
how come muslims more-so understand what s happening in america and make their voice heard
they are bowing to culture  instead of christ! everything is about self  jesus said crucify self! that is not very popular.  listening to voddie baucham   he s awesome check him out  scripture alone! jesus said i am the way  the truth   the life  read the word there is the only place you will find truth! remember jesus said they hated him first.
what  2nd timothy chapter 3 talks about..  having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof ...hypochristians...
humanism is wrong. our humanity is our lowest form  good only in pursuit of spiritual completeness.our tolerance is our weakness.bad trees will never bear good fruit. no king but jesus!

its because more people are having a hard time thinking an invisible man in the sky that  randomly does magic and necromancy but not to any detectable pattern or for any detectable reason. who cant even give the same copy of its book  to everybody..  even exists.. all you folks say to think critically and then you utterly stop doing that when it comes to your favorite flavor of magic sky man..i love ya.. but the sooner you rip that bandaid off the better..
as to why the church is dying and this is to add to my previous it s been over a dozen years but something like that that i had taking to the church the notion that the teaching about one left behind and one taken needed the addition of a few other verses awning that chapter where it tells where the one was taken what do the supper of god not a place a christian should be i watch this go around the world oh i couldn t take it directly to the church i was not a member of the church my wife was this type of stupidity it s what s written in the bible i remember many servings listening that you wanted to be the one taken when just a few more verses and it clearly states where you go if you re taken and how is it a simple man as myself good see and get it brought forward you did say it s the work of god and i would have to agree that god was certainly and most likely overtime and in aggrieve state because we re smarter than this we are his children what he told his disciples that you re to be armed he didn t exclude anybody but yeah you take this to the church and they hold up the silliness that two disciple said they had or sword the christ was fixing to be crucified how many times in the scripture had it s been put forward lord how long do i have to suffer these fools here just said get yourself a sword not some of you but he said get yourself a sword eddie likely knew he was going to be sweating blood a few moments later and they re not listening to him at all just the way it seems most folks read the bible if this seems a bit harsh i have hurt about this many years the best i can tell is most of the leadership of the churches have been infiltrated buy folks that want to destroy the church and god what entity comes to mind is the catholic leadership in rome there are no doubt others that have that end in mind also
bible believers do have a leader......jesus.  most think he won t be the leader until he returns which  likely  is what their church is telling them. but  he is king now and he looks for those who are obedient to god s commandments  statutes and judgements. article vi of the constitution states  in part...  this constitution  and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof  and all treaties made  or which shall be made  under the authority of the united states  shall be the supreme law of the land ...   in other words  men s laws are the supreme law of the land....not god s law.  that s a problem for god s people. furthermore  why would a country culture promote freedom of religion thereby allowing the freedom to bow to any and all gods or idols  seems to me israel of old had this problem when they turned from their god and began bowing to the gods and idols of the nations around them.  could it be that we have the same problem now  if so  where are the churches   the church is dying   perhaps so. it would seem to me that church should have some sort of impact on the culture of a nation  good or bad.  it would be hard for me to say the culture in america has improved lately. instead  i would say its degraded over time. what would that say about church
i am a conservative catholic  and i see our church moving in liberal directions.  i am so disappointed.   this pope is just terrible.
hmm if your christian why do you have a candle rake behind you
my faith is not in a church but in jesus christ and him alone...do you think the holy spirit is going to reside in something dead where there s no repentance and full of witch craft.. the lord tells us that the day will come of the falling away and that is not to be judged by church attendance but by those who turn away from him...
happy to see the institutionalized  church  fade away. about time. it s a blessing.
as soon as i turned 16 and didnt have to go to church i didnt go. i never liked it and could see through it all even as a kid. what a joke.
we re porked
do you believe in jesus  i have to ask because i think you re unawares of what is about to happen with the church.
the church is dieing because it no longer follows the word of god.period.
god does not live in things made with mans hands.
here is one  ask yourself  why did our heavenly father send his son our lord christ jesus the first time  now ask yourself why would he return the second time  what is it that humanity and religion have to do with this
going... going... gone.  good riddance  christianity turned from the truth eons ago!
jesus recommended and even demanded that all of his apostles be martyred except for john.  jesus only allowed the apostle john to die a natural death as it was said in the new testament.  this is also confirmed in the unrecognized gospel of mary magdalene. therefore  if someone thinks that jesus died for  their  sins  then he is mistaken.  everyone who wants to be cleansed of his sins and be saved from eternal torment must renounce the kingdom of the earth and renounce himself and must be ready for martyrdom  as was said and demanded by jesus himself and  accordingly  he  as it were  set a personal example.simon or peter was crucified upside down.andrew  after scourging  was crucified without nails and tied to a cross and died two days later. james  the son of zebedee  was beheaded. bartholomew - he was skinned alive and then beheaded. thomas was killed with spears. matthew was killed with a knife.  there are other versions  either he was burned at the stake or stoned to death.james  the son of alphaeus  was beaten with stones and sticks. judas iscariot allegedly hanged himself. philip was crucified upside down. judas thaddaeus was killed by bow arrows. simon the zealot was sawn alive with a saw. only john died of natural causes.        mark 8 27-38  and jesus went out  and his disciples  into the towns of caesarea philippi  and by the way he asked his disciples  saying unto them  whom do men say that i am and they answered  john the baptist  but some say  elias  and others  one of the prophets.and he saith unto them  but whom say ye that i am  and peter answereth and saith unto him  thou art the christ.and he charged them that they should tell no man of him.and he began to teach them  that the son of man must suffer many things  and be rejected of the elders  and of the chief priests  and scribes  and be killed  and after three days rise again.and he spake that saying openly. and peter took him  and began to rebuke him.but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples  he rebuked peter  saying  get thee behind me  satan  for thou savourest not the things that be of god  but the things that be of men.and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also  he said unto them  whosoever will come after me  let him deny himself  and take up his cross  and follow me.for whosoever will save his life shall lose it  but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel s  the same shall save it.for what shall it profit a man  if he shall gain the whole world  and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation  of him also shall the son of man be ashamed  when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels.
agreed! she makes good points on other topics but loses me here. one can support liberty and be a libertarian and also be an atheist. murray rothbard  ayn rand were atheists. henry hazlitt and f a hayek were agnostics and libertarian as well. hazlitt wrote a book titled  the foundations of morality  and he doesn t make any appeals to religion.
@physicshypernova   same. im conservative to my core except not gonna play pretend with god any more than i will play pretend with trans gender nonsense.its either is a provable testable verifiable theory or it isnt.. and there is literally nothing to test or observe in the  theory of god the religious think we hate them. its worry and pity more than anything   except for the really loud ones  we just want them to wake up and devote all that positive effort they are wasting to something that actually helps or works.
nebraska here
the word  oh you mean like what few pulpits will preach  matthew 24 10 many will fall away. check. 11  many false prophets will arise and mislead many. check 12  lawlessness will be increased  most peoples love   for the father  son and holy ghost  and one another  will grow cold. check. jesus told us about the times we re in  but we can t talk about it  too negative  plus it gets all murky with the left behinders   pre- tribbers rapture types  mid tribbers  post tribbers and preterists  better just kick that aside  too divisive  might cause a split and lose tithing units.
believe the scriptures. some will be saved and some will not. the wheat and the tares will grown along one another. for god to be true everyman must be made a liar. is god true to me  the longer i live the more i believe god cannot lie and man cannot tell the truth.
the same religious totalitarianism that persecuted my scandinavian ancestors into subjugation  just like both political parties are two sides of the same coin  so too is christianity and judaism. i can hold the the same beliefs of freedom and the concept of a small government without religions that copy and paste.
no it isn t.
go woke  go broke. i dont miss the light shows and the bowling shoe wearing pastor talking about his family life. nope! not one bit......
why no ring   ... ahem.  just saying.
what is a hebrew bible believer  this woman is not a christian.
everything dies eventually. christian beliefs were murdered.
i have not attended any church in years. they re all about money. my wife became seriously ill in 2009 and as a result we became homeless. there are 2 mega churches in the area and i told the pastors about what was happening to my wife  stepson  who is autistic  and myself. out of a thousand people saying  ill pray for you   but not one said  how can we help you  . they do not represent christ nor do the act like it. this they should do 3and he shall set the sheep on his right hand  but the goats on the left. 34then shall the king say unto them on his right hand  come  ye blessed of my father  inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world  35for i was an hungred  and ye gave me meat  i was thirsty  and ye gave me drink  i was a stranger  and ye took me in  36naked  and ye clothed me  i was sick  and ye visited me  i was in prison  and ye came unto me. 37then shall the righteous answer him  saying  lord  when saw we thee an hungred  and fed thee  or thirsty  and gave thee drink  38when saw we thee a stranger  and took thee in  or naked  and clothed thee  39or when saw we thee sick  or in prison  and came unto thee  40and the king shall answer and say unto them  verily i say unto you  inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren  ye have done it unto me. 41then shall he say also unto them on the left hand  depart from me  ye cursed  into everlasting fire  prepared for the devil and his angels  42for i was an hungred  and ye gave me no meat  i was thirsty  and ye gave me no drink  43i was a stranger  and ye took me not in  naked  and ye clothed me not  sick  and in prison  and ye visited me not. 44then shall they also answer him  saying  lord  when saw we thee an hungred  or athirst  or a stranger  or naked  or sick  or in prison  and did not minister unto thee  45then shall he answer them  saying  verily i say unto you  inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these  ye did it not to me. 46and these shall go away into everlasting punishment  but the righteous into life eternal.
fk church. be a believer.
you are confusing religion with race.... the european race built this country...
the church that died long ago with judochristianbabylonianzionism. there s only one way.
absolutely horrible title! the church is the body of christ not a religion! get your facts straight! the body of christ is strengthening like never before. not the fake church you re referring to which i and many in the body of christ don t belong to!
europeans shouldn t worship magical chews imho.
just glad im a pagan wiccan.
i have not attended any church in years.  you say that like it s a virtue. if you claim to be a follower of christ  you are commanded to gather for worship. if you are not  aside from any health issues or something like that  you are in disobedience.
what on earth are you talking about
@yesica1993  jesus is a magical j-w  used as mind control. the character is based on sumerian mythology if you put in the work and do just a tiny bit of research. it s time to grow up.
sad sad sad
only until the day of judgment  then not so glad.
