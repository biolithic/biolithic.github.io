am blasian  mom is from west africa  dad s pacific islander  both immigrated to usa  and I have never asked for  representation  in anything.  if you want a fair representation of me in video games or movies  then make a protagonist who s a devout Christian and isn t jaded by their faith.  I care way more about that than my skin color.

coincidentally  I just finished rise of the tomb raider and have to say I enjoyed it more than I expected.

I truly love  your videos and especially the daily Bible passage  your delivery is 10 10. please keep it up. this channel is a bright light on youtube these days. praying for you aunt . ill see you in your discord.

melonie  I saw you in a video with chrissie mayr the other day and really liked what you had to say. you stood up for your faith and stood your ground. that won me over. 

hI melonie.  came over from the quartering right at the start of go boom! and have been enjoying it immensely.  as far as lara goes  if you have not had a chance to read any of the top cow comics tomb raider series  early 2000 s   I would highly recommend it.  it does a great job of showing lara as both an attractive woman  and also a bad ass adventuress.  and while I am myself a pagan  I am enjoying your selections of Bible verses.

your voice matters as much as anyone else s. especially cause youre a big fan of the franchise. opinions and criticisms from true fans is very important. and I respect the quote from the Bible as a Bible reader myself.

wow. Im pretty sure this is the 1st video of yours Ive ever seen and I am thoroughly impressed by the breadth of your knowledge. I was not expecting to go from an analysis of lara croft to Bible verses. great analysis all around and I look forward to more!

bruh  instant subscription from me for being the first yt channel Ive seen that uses Bible verses in casual pop culture analyses. I think youre cool

very cool with the Bible verses. please keep it up.also  I used to love lara croft but kind of fell out of the loop with the games.

saw you on fnt  I like your takes and I appreciate the forthright Bible reading  which I wasn t expecting

keep up the good work  while a Christian Im not really one for church but Ive got to say you are a good gateway into the Bible haha. I wish you many more subscribers!

thank you melonie for always adding a Bible verse in your videos. I cant really say that Im a religious Christian  but I am a spiritual one. I believe in God and his son Jesus  I just haven t read the Bible as much as I should probably have.

ok  reciting Bible versus  youre the coolest chick on yt

Bible study  gamer  tats....where have you been my whole life  new subscriber!

loved the Bible verse I think people of our modern time dont understand Jesus that he was never one to mince words that he was against people who unnaturally propped themselves up as kings and wise men such as these woke people trying to tell us how we should think also I agree old laura is much better I dont really like mega boob laura but I like laura s old femme fatale look you could just tell she had seen some stuff even without the story sad this form of visual story telling is lost on most non indie games

that was the best Bible verse for this situation. subbed

I loved seeing you bust out some scripture at the end of your talk here. straight fire. Im subbing for the 3rd    time  in the last 8 years   thanks for keeping at it  melonie.

thank you for making all these videos  I really appreciate the content you put out and the much needed distraction from the day to day.

yours so thought I d just say thanks for being such a breath of fresh air  especially within the gaming space. never forget that you speak for the majority who seem to have lost their voice  and dont let the vocal minority break you down.
