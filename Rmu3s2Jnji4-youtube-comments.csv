i m so proud to see a young woman fighting to be recognized and respected as a women and not bending the knee.
picking out our traits and using them as a personality  well spoken! stealing that!
i m still unhappy about how pikamee got bullied over this nonsense. what really made my blood boil was seeing comments about how some were  proud  that she  chose  not to stream the game... there s a ton of people in complete denial that there s any bullying going on  and a ton of it is directed towards people who aren t even aware of all the twitter drama that started this all.
my favorite thing is that they tried spoiling the ending of the main story and everyone s like  that ending s awesome!! i can t wait to play it!!
they re just mad that their boycott didn t work. cope and seethe. this game is incredible.
it s so ironic that the group that cries about being bullied were so quick to bully others
my teacher at hogwarts told me that there once was a dark wizard who used a extremely forbidden spell called illius mentallius on a entire generation. these people are now called the wokians. these wokians are forever trapped in a bubble of depression and delusion and want to be worshipped like gods and act very crazy when ignored. luckily u can easily recognize these wokians since the spell changed all their hair colors and  pronounce and should be avoided at all times since there is a chance at contagion.
those hater tears are so hydrating! can t wait for the next hl stream today.  hope you re having a wonderful day melonie. you look fantastic
from what i can tell  there are a lot of streamers that weren t even aware of the  controversy  around the game.  a lot of them found out that people who they thought were their friends really weren t.  its sad  but i also think these streamers learned a necessary and harsh life lesson.
eat a steak and lift some weights  please  haha.. this woman gets it!
the fact that they ve been going around posting spoilers really reveals them for what they are  petulant little children throwing a tantrum because they didn t get their way.
as a 16 year old girl  i cannot tell you how much i appreciate your work melonie!seeing how my generation is getting dragged into this..even here in germany  it makes me sick..and scared for our future..for my future..i m happy my brother brought me to the world of mangas and animes  he is also a big youtuberand i might make cringy content for now..but it s all a part of me growing in art and editing is what he told me.i want to study medicine in 2 years from now and have youtube as my little project that keeps my mind busy.but seeing people getting harrased for playing a game  especially youtubers and streamers i love..and some even cry..makes my heart break.please keep up the good motivation  sometimes people need a slap on their face to wake up and understand that harrasment of any kind..is wrong and that you can t have everything in life..life is often cruel  it was for me and my brother..those people have no idea how easy they have it..
shame they have attacked sweet vtubers who try to make everyone happy on twitter like pikamee because she was excited for this game and 9 10 these people dont watch them just looking to make others feel miserable as they are in life.
i especially love the message at the end. everyone needs to get healthier and they ll be happier too.
his voice tells me everything i needed to know.
having a mental breakdown online because someone you don t even watch is playing a game based on a book written by an author who said something you disagree with. it s so utterly insane you can t help but laugh. it s hard to believe any of this drama is actually real.
that s true. celebrating mental illness doesn t help. we need to help not validate it. we need to keep praying and speaking out more. have a wonderful day melonie.
it s crazy to me that people will tell people they should be happy with the unhealthy body they are in with body positivity telling obese people they are fine  while telling children they shouldn t be happy with the healthy body they are in. how backwards is that
just a warning  if you are playing this game stay off twitter. they re now trying to post spoilers of the game to ruin it so people don t want to download of it.
they see the haters  they laughing.the game is awesome and i love the salt from the left over this game.
we all need to start doing that because men shouldn t be afraid of being masculine and women shouldn t be afraid of being feminine but these wokies are the ones promoting the very thing they complain about.
@nathan beales  the women are proving to be better warriors in the fight against the wokes.
melonie is a good christian gal out here speaking her mind and she s said some key things over time that show she gets it
@luther drache  not really but ok
@luther drache  hmm  not at all. that being said  don t go down that road.
this is what actual feminists should fight for  not bitching and crying over not being able to get a free abortion in every state while they ignore their right to self defense is being taken away. equality.
@hunk mr. death  i mean you can discuss both rightsi don t get this line of thinking its like when people say why is nasa not exploring the seas and then act as if its all we care about and not like oceanic organizations do exist.
melonie is so kind  understanding  respectful and a true class act. love her long time
bend the knee only to the lord our god  and things work out.
i had to explain character traits to my kid the other day while working on a dnd character. i had to tell them the difference between who you are and what you are.
worst
it s funny because women pretending to be men do the same thing.it s quite annoying.
@chandller burse  true  but not many people are gonna rape someone whose armed. they d prefer the unarmed  easier to overpower them
@nathan beales  i am just afraid of existing lol
people are actually denying the bullying  i could see them saying it s not the trans people but the trans activists doing it but they can t deny the bullying altogether. can they
@jcais88_hbtc  can confirm. they are denying or downplaying it all over twitter  but some of us have screenshots to prove it.whenever i share the screenshots  they stop responding.
are they off limits to bully and harass  no one should harass or bully anyone. still unhappy.. why only bullying and harass people playing and enjoying the game is only fine..  no one should bully and harass anyone.
@jcais88_hbtc as far as i m concerned the trans activists and the trans community are of the same coin
@jcais88_hbtc  oh they can. various people throughout history have done it. effin  gobshyt.
not to mention thegaymer downplaying all of the bullying.  this isn t new  woke bullying has been happening since 2009  after a certain presidency  but it s now bleeding into the games domain.
i love spoilers. i like knowing how something ends because i am more curious about the journey than the destination.
the spoiler isn t even that big of a twist  if you were paying attention you would have had your own suspicions from just watching the prologue and a little bit of the early game.
i am glad i wasn t targeted by the haters like that because i dont want spoilers for the game  having endings spoiled for me ruins the game because i play the game for the story.
@anonymous cheese  i am also more curious about the journey but i hate spoilers because it lessens the impact that moment would have on me when i finally get to that point.
i ve spoiled myself rotten on several games... i still play them because the ending never ever equates to the full experience of playing a game.
@luther drache i mean for many games it is.many linear cinematic games.even though i repetitively replay myself the last of us really is one of those i feel. same for uncharted you basically nearly experienced it all just by beating it.
beyond that  the best part of the game is the actual gameplay and the experience of exploring the world and casting flipendo. i m still bitter that the story got spoiled  but it absolutely didn t affect my enjoyment of the game because of how good everything else about it is.
how did they spoil the ending without playing it  hmm i though they don t support the game by purchasing it
also the spoiler people were posting was something i could tell was going to happen from just watching the intro gameplay. like seriously if you re going to post spoilers make it something unexpected.
my favourite thing is that they know the story when they are supposed to be boycotting it
@steve j  i got cancelled from twitter for going to war against them  but i m continuing to denounce the bullying in other platforms.
@luther drache  that s definitely something i didn t see happening. figured we d be able to play games however we wanted. i mean it is just a damn wizard game that has nothing to do with hurting trans people.
wait what    but pika is a honey bun  un pan de dios  as we say in my country
the fuck  really  but it s pikamee. whyyy
we re proud you guys are cooperating!  - nazi capo to jews boarding the train
@theforsakeneagle  thats not exactly the words they used but fair enough i guess lol.
pika is the last person you would think would be attacked. i m still pissed at these activists
she bent the knee  she gets no sympathy
@iacon dawnshire i m a trans person  i know many other trans people. none of them would suggest you don t play this game  because they are actually rational people who just have a quirk in the expression of their self. i ve studied psychology for 7 years  these activists you see  especially the ones out in public who make no real effort to appear as their gender preference and shriek and complain  do not match the profile that people who are genuinely trans overwhelmingly follow. this is woke people  they have already made attempts to undermine the process in which people are properly diagnosed  many don t even bother to get diagnosed. they are not sincere  they are people who were starved of attention  or have no real value in their lives  and decided that their cause was to  protect  people by affording them rights nobody else has. the woke people hijack minorities and use them as a sword and shield to pursue an unrealistic vision of justice and protect themselves from criticism. the  actually trans  community should speak more about this  and i m sorry for my shortcomings in helping people understand that this is the case. but if you want to play the game  i want you to play the game  and nobody i call a friend would have it any other way.
i still haven t seen these spoilers because i heard it was happening and just avoided the comments until i finished the game.
agreed
ah don t worry next month they ll boo hoo and cry about the next thing lol
it s not bad  but incredible is a stretch.
@tech priest  to some it is.  i m not a potter fan but i find the game a ton of fun. my sister absolutely loves it and she s a potter fanatic.  bottom line is this game has been a critical and commercial success
the game is so good. only got to play a tad bit last night. it s amazing combat is so fun. go watch mighty keef  trying to play hogwarts legacy.  dude is amazing  but that video in particular is just straight spitting fire  facts  lol. love this game.
indeed! even angry joe and crew like the game. i ve been on their stream everyday and just now a few minutes from posting this  i heard them say they really are enjoying it right now
@haz kaj  i read the books as a kid  and i was hoping for more exploration and choice.the fact it is a linear story is what ended up disappointing. excluding all the modern woke stuff in the game.mind you  i m not saying it s bad. combat is well done  and the puzzle s are mostly both creative and simple. it s just not  incredible  in my book.
@enclavemain   how could you agree with this guy  what is wrong with everyone  this game is beyond  incredible they just need to touch up on some glitches though.
i don t give a damn about harry potter and i m buying this game. if anything they helped sell the game
they re called crybullies. they bully other people into doing what they want  but when other people don t do what they want  they see it as an attack. if you defend yourself  they ll cry about you attacking them while they re trying to bully you  hence the term  crybully  . it s really the extreme side of a person always seeing themselves as a victim.
@gabriel  exactly
because if you bully them you re a transphobe  homophobe  bigot  bad perosn whatever. but if they bully you  they have a justified reason and u should kneel and beg for forgiveness

lol spot on
yoo!!!! this had me dying!!!
a simple lumos spell will illuminate the way back for them.
there is a simple spell that can counter their arguments  just flick you wand and yell  biologio facto!
@madiq ismal
transius trendius was also casted.
looking forward to the gaslight campaign when they get caught being hypocrites again.
@william cooper  not gonna lie you had me in the first half.
agreed  mate!
i ve seen some live stream videos of hogwarts and when i get the money i plan on buying it
is the game actually good i ve seen and heard reviews seems epic
@moe s gaming  probably chappelle again.
@moe s gaming  and when they do  we can remind them how well it worked for them when they tried it for hogwarts legacy
@steviegoy  the game is great  there are minor glitches that needs to be fixed. this is a must buy in my opinion.
@william cooper  unless it s spider-man 2 on ps2 no licensed game can be beyond incredible.
@steviegoy  i have it  played so far 27ish hours  i love it! there are a few bugs like getting stuck occasionally but hopefully with the next patch it will be fine. also you can pretty much explore right after the first hour or two
many of those calling for boycotts announced they re gonna pirate the game.  ha! no money for jk! . these people refuse to agree to disagree. refuse to separate the artist from the art. guilt by association. they even went after simon pegg  a trans ally  for voicing a character in the game. by their standard  or lack there of  that makes the piraters closet transphobes transphobe adjacent.
@hazxbox  yeah  i think you re spot on. to potter fans  it s probably the game game they ve been waiting for since childhood. me   never having watched the hp movies  still find it fun but not on the level of rdr2 or tw3.
@n. e.g  yes... or rather a greater flipendo would flip  em off.
if you interact with them there is a chance you ll cringe so bad you ve very unlikely to recover
reducio on their inflated self-importance could dispel the illius mentallius completely and turn them into gollum like figure who lost the ring of power... erm... wrong fantasy game engorgio on the other hand might send their already inflated ego into a violent explosion... ending their  self-inflicted  torment and suffering...
thank you so much! stoked for stream too  i m pre recording a couple videos  making lunch  then starting stream  d
@melonie mac go boom  prediction  that lunch is going to have butter or cream cheese.
@melonie mac go boom  hope you have a great weekend with your family  too  melonie.
the tears could make some rivers right now lol
wait... you guys gettin  hydrating tears   i keep getting these salty af ones.
go outside more
@van damage cry
@kurgan0822  sounds fattening.also good but fattening lol
yeah people only wanna collab and use others for their own personal gain
hopefully they learned  if there are of the rainbow hair you must beware
@house wilma  lol that reminds me of the coral snake identification rhymes.
i honestly have no idea what they are bitching about. there is clearly a woke identity checklist agenda in this game  and i would think that would satisfy them. but apparently not.
@zack fair  the one trans character s name is apparently transphobic. nothing is ever good enough.
@kurgan0822  its transphobic that they added a trans character to the game   reeee
that statement needs to be on a shirt
@house wilma  me who has coloured hair just for fun   .
pandering is bad
if they found   their friends really weren t  . then  yeah  they were not their friends.
@sya  they added a trans character and didn t make a big deal about it. that right there is transphobic and a hate crime  according to those people.
any  cutting out toxic friends speedrun though  so at least there s that lmao
100  this.
it makes me want to keep track of everyone posting spoilers on twitter and spoil whatever tv show anime game they play watch next in a few months because i m a petty bitch lol. holding this grudge until i die.
hasnt anyone asked how they know the story if they are boycotting the game
you should make some content. start small  post some gameplay videos and have fun with it. we look forward to it and you can do it. just work hard and keep watching good content.never give up your principles too. don t bend the knee and allow society to control you. be authentic and you ll definitely go far  kid. good luck and god bless you.
@moe s gaming  yea i thought about doing genshin..videos. not really gaming  but rather informational content  or even educational. the content i m working on right now is rather some cringy content to learn how to edit..draw etc.thank you so much for your feedback
you give me hope for the younger generation  it s refreshing to see smart and stable young minds such as yours
@gacha life counts  be careful around the internet  i would recommend doing it with an adult if you are making content  too many bad actors...if you want to support a good cause without joining the alphabet cult the lgb alliance is a nice alternative as well...
@galaxy  sadly i joined  lgtb  communities twice now  both were super toxic..and full of 8-12 year olds  who think they have shizophrenie and other mental illnesses..and once i said i joined because one of my closest friends who is 19..came out to me as trans and i wanted to support her  they called me a transphobe  because i didn t understand it..they bashed me and said horrible things.. the second one was more kind  but it ended up the same  when someone made up weird pronouns..and i accidently said  him  they just straight up banned me  i didn t even say something else..my friend is fine now  she has a boyfriend who supports her and they keep it to themselve  which is actually quiet nice  she also got therapy and wants to go to university and become a ..what is it called  not a doctor  but someon who like  breaks  your bones to make them feel better..not really breaking but you know. she also has bad experience with those communities..they often treat it as an accessoire to show off..she even plays hogwarts legacy and is in love with it..and supports woman rights  she also understood that born as a male  she has a different biology and would never dare to compete in woman sports.. that is why i accept her as a woman..because she earned it  but this guy in the video..he is the worst.. but big but  you helped me  i should really join some communities  like youtuber once  where i can learn and grow! maybe art  i really love drawing and i will be more carefull from now on  i don t mind getting hate for what i m saying  the amount of people i blocked on my channel is enourmous  i also have a blacklist of words..so i don t mind it  don t worry  over the last 2 years i got the worst things told to me  but that is part of my journey and my brother supports me    thanks again! sorry for the books i wrote!
@lingr icen  yea but they are only like 2-3  of those born in that year..remember that! my brother teached me to be kind and have empathy and he is born 1992  his girlfriend 1997  both are kind and helped me grow up.he teached me what empathy means and not to take hate etc. seriously  often just to accept and ignore it  but also tell people my point of view and try to look at it from their perspective. but while you are right  they sadly influence my generation..and seeing 8-12 year olds identifying more and more as mental illnesses  saying they are shizophrenic  bipolar and use made up pronouns..shows me that even tho it might be 2  of that generation that influences them..sadly that loud minority has a big impact.. a reason i like asia more and more.. they have traditions  empathy and trans people are kind over there  they don t act like scumbags and just accept themselves and others..instead of shouting and parading like lunatics..and they don t bring sexualization into children classes..like they do in america and canada right now..which scares me.
@gacha life counts  this is why even if you want to support your trans friends or your gay friends you have to stay away from these communities! they re not really your friends they re just in bubbles!also there are good trans people  like your friend  but there are a lot of bad actors  that s why i mentioned the lgb alliance to you because it s a good way to support gays without having the t people take away their rights...i don t know what advice i should give to you around online communities. most are just people that stay online 24 7 and that makes them mostly insane so i really advise you not to join any community! i myself keep it to entertainment online like videogames and try and socialize outside i find this the best way... also am glad there are trans people like your friend. i also hope they make it clear to whoever they have relationship with to state they re trans otherwise that s devoid of consent!
life is also often pointless feeling lol.
@chandller burse  truer words have never been said   life might be pointless  but only if you give it no sense of purpose. even taking care of a flower  can give it purpose  but having nothing  might make it seem pointless..
@gacha life counts  i unfortunately kind of say this as a nihilistic tangent of sorts kind of jokingly as a christian i don t even know why maybe i just want to pose a question to make people ponder their own beliefs deeper and accept we are all in this together without having to.or maybe i am just projecting self hatred as misanthropy and basically saying we as a species are absolutely pathetic and will probably amount to nothing in the history of this bigger universe.
@gacha life counts  sorry you went through that. glad you re developing a thick skin in response  because you ll need it. hang in there!
@ranmouri82  no one in politics has thick skin when they get mad at pride flags and confederate statues
ich antworte dir einfach mal auf deutsch! gr  e gehen raus  aus welchem bundesland auch immer du kommen magst. dein bruder und seine freundin klingen nach sehr netten menschen. ich selbst bin jahrgang 1988 und mit harry potter buchst blich gro  geworden. es irritiert mich  wie sich unser soziales umfeld gerade entwickelt und ich wei  nicht so recht  was ich mit der aufforderung einer v llig fremden menschengruppe  mit der ich keinerlei ber hrungspunkte habe  anfangen soll. tats chlich habe ich auch einen transsexuellen freund  der in berlin lebt   der spielt das spiel  brigens auch. und obschon er rowling nicht mag  h lt er sich aus der ganzen bubble raus und sagt selbst  dass die trans-community super toxisch ist. grunds tzlich soll jeder machen  was er will. womit ich nicht konform gehe ist  dass wir frauen von  frauen  angegangen und beleidigt werden  like   wtf  in dieser ganzen diskussion um rowling und ihre aussagen wird irgendwie total untergraben  dass wir frauen eben auch unter diskriminierung leiden. dass wir als frauen f r unsere rechte sehr lange k mpfen mussten  immer noch unterbezahlt werden  dass m nner unsere vorfahrinnen am scheiterhaufen als hexen verbrannt haben... ich finde  wir haben einfach das recht zu sagen  wir schlie en uns dieser transgender-bewegung nicht an. warum denn auch  muss man  berall dabei sein   wie gesagt  mich l sst das ganze thema sehr irritiert zur ck und ich bin teilweise recht fassungslos  was f r hammer aus der aktivistenszene kommen. das schl gt dem fass wirklich den boden aus... w nsche dir viel gl ck bei deinem youtube-kanal und deinem studium! viele gr  e aus bayern
@eva  whats with the german
i was watching silvervale the other day play it and she handled it really well. her mods were on top of it  but even when some negative stuff slipped through  she just ignored it. at the end of the stream she had a nice message saying to just be kind to people and let them enjoy the games they like. i was a little disappointed at some of the chatters who supported the game too. seemed like some of them were eager for a fight.
@lark88  to be fair id like to fight bullies too.anyone who shames some for playing this game deserves to be shamed simple as.
@house wilma  sure  but there s a time and place for that. fighting in the chat while the streamer is trying to have fun isn t it. besides fighting chat bullies are the mod s job and they were doing fine.
@lark88  you can troll them and have fun with it too. you can do what melonie did and put your character name as  ima biggit . we should fight back with comedy because the woke cannot stand comedy
@moe s gaming  sure  if that s what the streamer wants  but read the room first.
it s a shame campaign. just more bullies.
silver is freaking awesome. equal parts wholesome and degenerate.
i don t think thats gonna happen for me at least not physically.i need mental health help i suppose
like nails on a chalkboard  man
a gay man using a female vampire or whatever as an avatar. kinda tells me everything i need to know before they went on a rant.
it does give me  alright lads. first butterbeer s on me.  vibes.
he sounds as if he s on the verge of tears. it s clear that what he thinks is strength is actually an illusion  since he doesn t come off as strong  at all. total beta. i mean  he s trying to act like he doesn t care  but everything he s saying screams the opposite.
@anonymous cheese most vtubers are often men using female anime loli girls though lol.
@anonymous cheese  it shouldn t  that s not very wise. wait for people to tell you how stupid they are in their own words.
then you re seeing jesus in pancakes my friend. it s not clever. not everyone who sounds like that is going to be like him.
@geek  seeing jesus in pancakes never heard that one.
i know  i don t game anymore and haven t in a long time. but i subscribe to her channel because i m interested in what s going on in society.
@edward bernard   don t game anymore but am interest in society you lead a horrible existence and i pity you.most games are still better than this
dude thats not the point   the point here is people trying to boycott a good game that was made with care and love denying their creators from their well deserved earnings because of one person s views opinions.
@andres gonzalez  true. but celebrating and even fetishizing mental illness and disorders is part of the issue. a lot of the same type of people that are for this madness  are the same type of people i ve sat with and hear them talk as if they were caught n tumblr. examples below... there is an article that says that there is more gender confusion in autistic children than in neurotypical kids. that s because autism is awesome and we know what s what. i am autistic by the way... i found this line of theirs  entirely confusing and honestly somewhat ignorant. i was diagnosed with adhd   autism! this is usually followed some days later with. i finally got adderall! and then there is... i have dislexia. i can t read  hahah. there are many things they say where the tone is missed in text. but they do celebrate having these things or being diagnosed with these things. or even using it as an excuse or seeking diagnosis to the point where one of them started imitating even my speech patterns to get diagnosed.this is getting ridiculous. we have a generation that records their cries and panic attacks and depression... and it started with the cebration of disorders  calling them gender non conformity and not by the name it has which is disphoria. we went to surgery rather than treating the illness itself or underatanding the reasoning behind it. i grew up with the challenges of being autistic and having adhd  and maintaining my discipline so i can have a somewhat normal life and work within society and people who are not like me. but a lot of these people do not want to work with others. they want the world to work for them.and  of course the people who attacking streamers here and pushing for this hatred are the same people who would want to have the world bent to their perspective. and that  is a mental disorder that is called a movement...
@sarn  excelsior
i relate it to a person who is addicted to heroine. these people are not helping  they are giving more drugs until they overdose and die
cause to them misery happiness
@al malone  our misery   their happiness.
that s really dumb to do in a way they are supporting something they hate or it will make people buy it
if only they cared this much about the child trafficking in america or the genocide in armenia
they are doing this everywhere. even posting screenshots of them posting it on their personal accounts elsewhere such as discord and facebook and even youtube comments. id stay off all social media till you beat the game if you care
to be fair the main story line is actually the weakest part of it like skyrim and fallout.
i actually seen someone do that  if they can t stop someone through emotional manipulation from buying the game they will just spoil the game and in which case they need to be fucking banned as they are intentionally trying to ruin the experience
that s so dumb  people everywhere are watching their favorite streamers play. yet another l.
they post the spoilers everywhere.  in live streams  in youtube comments. its so pathetic
@house wilma  it s predictable for sure  but how it s presented is top notch. that opening with them in the carriage being pulled by thestrals is among one of the best intros i ve seen in game in a long time. the voice acting  the animations  the production value  and the little touches from the lore that are shown rather than told. i ve played 7 hours of it so far and i m absolutely in love with the game.
melonie hits the nail in the head again.  not enough people think about how foods affect our mental health as well.
thank you  it s so refreshing seeing someone with a voice  actually speaking truth about reality  meaningful words  while trying to protect their passion and people of all stages of life.
even now they can t see they are apart of a vocal minority  it s astounding.
love the courage to come out and call it what it is....mental illness. got my sub.  keep spreading the truth!!!
i m so glad that i discovered vtubing from japan first  where content creators are talented  awesome and just good people in general. i know many people that only know this kind of cringe vtubers and think this is all there is
you are right... its a trend and there are more trans people today because its something that s in style... people  especially kids  are easily manipulated into thinking they are something which they aren t.  its promoted and cheered on and celebrated  so more and more people want to be part of it  and are even convinced into thinking they actually are.
i m loving watching that subscriber count grow. well done  melonie!
this is what happens when you feed too many men soy  lmao
the fact is that there is not a single person who subscribes that trend who has experienced anything remotely close to the things that they re pretending to be victims of.
we need more women like you out there. fuckin based.
there part in me that i hate that i get praised for my autism and other mental health. yes i believe we should encourage others to get help  have good mental health and maybe inspire other to that they can get through it and if you have a disability it doesn t define you. however it seems by doing this it has lend to people jumping on the trend because they are either bored  want that attention or something. my aunt who is a works at a private  christian  school has been saying it s a trend.
damn! save some iconic quotes for the next video. eat a steak and lift some weights  taking in all of the worst traits you re great. love your content
girl  i became a fan because you re not afraid to face the woke bullies.  i m following your twitch channel and will stand behind you all the way!
trans-trender  is such a good description that i will be using.
i just found your channel and i completely agree with you thank you for what you are doing its great to hear that other people are spreading awareness on this stuff
you ve got a really good point about the nutrition too  melonie. i ve been trying my best to lose weight and fight my obesity  and the more weight i ve lost  the happier i feel. plus cutting sugars really low and eating a bunch of fat  keto diet  is giving me more energy too. healthy fats of course  like the ones you find in beef  avocado  coconut  and pork.
all i ll say is how the freakin  heck do you not lose any sanity by watching that rant. you  melonie mac  got a lot of guts and alot more tenacity to keep doing what you re doing - and i commend you. thanks so much  melonie mac! go boom!!
love your content. i don t think i ve found any other youtuber with the spine to call out the trans issue like you have. it s so sad what s happening to these people.
theirs a few things i d wish they would ve added was having a morality system. have each character able to either hate you or love you based on the decision if you agree with them or not. have characters be able to  die  meaning expelled  suspended  or injured to affect the story. have multiple endings true evil ending  evil ending  neutral ending  good ending  and true good ending.
we re being bullied  turned into  we re going to bully you  really fast. thankfully as i ve been streaming this i ve had limited negativity.
also tick tock  someone popped up on my fyp page and spoiled the ending. i was livid. first video that came up to.
it s amusingly suspicious how they even know the spoilers.even if they are just reading and watching it to learn the ending. they are raising it s algorithm and the internet will just raise it s marketing.maybe that s why i see the ad so often.i also heard how some people are giving lessons to how to hide you re hl achievements. if you want to play the game  but don t want people to know about it.which just makes the suspicion of them buying the game all the more amusingly ironic.
@michael  thoughts and prayers is all they ll get for support  from the people who vilify religion.
ngl watching these spoiler just make me wanna buy and play it myself
a vocal minority that everyone is getting really sick of these people need to shut up and go about there lives.
it may not seem like it at first  but vtubers are very diverse group of people even among western vtubers.
japan is one of the last places on earth mostly free from wokeness.  i am sure it is creeping its way there slowly  but they are a couple decades behind the west.  anime is a good outlet for when you get frustrated over western media all bowing to the mob.
dude  it doesn t get more based than slytherin having no less than five members of hololive in their house xd
@laytonaster  it was mandatory for war crime peko to end up in slytherin xd
nah vtuber is entirely cringe...even the name lmao
@toolness1 it is  i follow a couple of japan vtubers and they already have some wokeness
@funtourhawk  they make tens of thousands happy every day. what s cringe about that
@arthur scotchfir  salazar slytherin is probably a nousagi
@nb mad  i sometime consume clips of them but bruh there are many that felt like focking teletubbies with their high pitch voices it makes my earss bleed
@toolness1 japan is quite liberal i thought  it just isn t the same there as it is here.and besides japan has a strict culture of quality over quantity  arguable when it comes to konami and such and a strict often cruel work culture thats why developers are legitimately potentially suicidal.its just too difficult to change.
@nb mad mean furries make people happy too and gay pride parades.but you would probably still call it cringe.its not like its bad because of that its just hard to watch it feels odd.and its always even male ones playing as anime loli girls.if anything bad came from japan its peoples obsession with underaged looking cartoon girls.and also probably hentai.and asian fetishes. but thats more on western men not japan or asia.
@chandllerburse737  you re generalizing. that s why i said i was glad to find good vtubers first. there are a lot of people like you who think all vtubers are all males with loli avatars or furries  and that s simply not the case. i recommend you any vtuber from hololive to start with  you ll just find talented  passionate people  showing a lot of good values on their streams
@nb mad  its not a generalizing. they are vtubers they are odd to me like furries.its how i feel about all even the female ones and most are loli anime girls dude
@nb mad  i don t care if its passionate talented people furries can be that too so are gay pride people.they live their life they do a lot good for them but its still odd and hard to watch them because i am so use to just watching people on youtube who either never show anything or just show their real face.and furries are just hard to believe they do this in public randomly at a group meeting sure but i have too much embarassment and guilt to do that lol.
@nb mad  i also never said they were furries you didn t even understand my comment.
read your comment right when she said it. that s always a treat  lol.
same
i also hate how this transition is preached as the solution when there s obvious risks when you mess up your hormones. that reminds me of people with autism mad at the toy story movie that preached you can just cure your autism  when in reality you just gotta live with it. it s so sad
@galaxy when did toy story ever say that
@galaxy whats more sad is anti vaxxer parents who literally seem to hate their kids for being autistic lol.
why do i have the urge now to use that as a new student name for hogwarts legacy
@mohawk_productions  trans trender and ima biggit will be best of friends.
@thatharvguy  lol
meanwhile it seems like all the hololive vtubers  japanese vtuber company  are playing hogwarts legacy without any negative comments  at least as far as i know. who knows what s going on on twitter tho
like 5-10 years ago when i was living in logan square chicago  hipster central  i was often blindly disturbed in the back of my mind and i couldn t put my finger on it.  i would be the only man helping girls move into their new apartment  setting up sound equipment for concerts  shoveling snow. and i m not anything special. watching your videos is helping a bunch of stuff click and make sense in my mind about life these days in our country...about why i often felt alone doing things when everyone else was at the bar with a pbr or rushing to try the new  cronut  or  edamame bean  food craze. thanks again!
this is a serious mental health issue in our country
the avalanche devs must be sitting in bewilderment  at all that s happened with what started out as just an ordinary teenage wizard role-playing game. kudos to them  looking forward to their next great game
meanwhile  hololive jp   id girls are enjoying the game  i ve been watching moona  who has had several long streams of hl  as are some of the phase connect and prism girls. if you search on twitch  small indie vtubers are streaming it  and i hope they are having fun  while more popular streamers there are avoiding it because they re scared.
great video as always. this is what it looks like when you cannot take a loss. they are an embarrassing bunch.
also i want to note that they preached about a video game and how horrible it is to consume on their child slave made phone and warlord produced pc parts to rig that vtuber model... the sheer hypocrisy .
i read the title and said to myself  i m betting the moment that v tuber will start talking i m gonna hear that forced female voice that make my skin crawl      i was right
there s nothing more dangerous to a person s sanity than a feminine male that uses big words they barely understand and buzz terms with a dose of endless acronyms
melonie  you quickly became one of my favorite youtubers of all time  3 i found your channel through this whole drama going on with hogwarts legacy and im loving your character.  1 subscriber  d
great message today! i m glad the woke mob isn t winning on this! also you look amazing today! i hope your daybis amazing too.
remember this is all because jk wont bend the knee and be forced into the cult. so for them to treat people like this just for playing a game they are hypocrites they are demons
wackivists    trans-trenders    ano-phobe ... this was culturally on point and your hilarious cacophemistic terms made me lmao   i loved this short vid. thx!
i lost two friends because i want to play this game  one on fb and when i put them on blast on twitter tagging melonie  i lost a second on twitter because she thinks melonie is a hateful person.
i love shorty..... we need more women like her
hey melonie. you look amazing. ready for the next stream
glad i found your channel. nice to watch like minded people  3
i absolutely love you melonie!!!!!!! you are prolly the only youtuber who see s this shit exactly the way i do and its always a good time to watch.
i used to struggle with gender and body dysmorphia when i was in my early 20s especially  and i m glad that i realized it was a disorder and something i could combat  rather than having to transition and make irreversible changes to my body. really sad to see people  even young children for god s sake  being told this is the answer to their problems. really sad to see.
awesome stuff mel  thanks for this
because in non-west  they dont tolerate the intolerable.   they curate their own cultures.
silvervale started playing it this week. her twitch chat was very positive  but her twitter replies to her stream announcement were very negative. she ended up deleted the twitter thread after stream.
i think gura chickened out and shylily refused to play in fear of doxxing but at least called the boycott and harassment stupid.
@toolness1  yeah  i haven t seen any holoen members play it yet
the more urbanized people are the less awareness they have of reality.
i blame education  media  pharma pills  and poor diet
@red man  most of that has to do with the whole rainbow cult thing.i m trying to help by supporting causes like lgb alliance which is more of a opposing force to the whole alphabet and t people narrative. i would suggest doing the same  assuming you want the gays to have their rights without celebrating mental illness.
@red man i blame liberals movies and violent video games.
@chandller burse  you blame violent video games  but your profile picture is arthur morgan from rdr2 which is rated m. this is bait.
@goldenotaku 79  it was a joke
@chandller burse  and that s why i called it bait
@goldenotaku 79  dur dur dur
@chandller burse  nice subtle joke  just as subtle as your sarcasm.
@goldenotaku 79  whats your problemi don t like either side of the political spectrum here i am sick of it all let me joke.
@chandller burse  what you need arthur is to have faith and money to follow dutch s god damn plan.
@natsu dragneel  almost every non poor person owns a bunch of stuff that isn t needed even when they make an excuse for it.
they went after simon pegg  trans ally  for voicing a character in the game. you know  a job. if they see him as transphobe adjacent  i see those breaking the boycott to pirate the game as closet transphobe transphobe adjacent too. see  we can use guilt by association too.
they weren t really your friend
that was the creepiest  cringiest  weirdest thing i ve ever seen and it got a whole lot more horrifying when i looked up this... thing on twitter. he literally invites you to his  dungeon  ! i m sure it s  kid friendly ...
this is what happens when you feed too many men soy.  omg melonie  you really had me laughing out loud there. that line was epic and perfectly delivered! good god...!
hey! trans person here who got properly diagnosed and made up my own damned mind about what to do about it. i play hogwarts legacy  breath of fresh air  perhaps not groundbreaking but well made for sure. i hope you all get the chance to give it a go.
i m lowkey in love with you haha. in all seriousness  keep being you. brave  forthright  honest  and above all else - normal! god forbid
that vtuber knows how it feels to get harassed. that s why the comments are off. you received the same energy you put out.
while all this is going on  i m just enjoying the hell out of the game
i think they have to go against everyone who disagrees because deep down there s a little voice of reason saying they re wrong. they are trying again and again to prove themselves they re right in order to silence that little voice but... it will never go away.
and other vtubers  especially non-western ones  were bullied away from playing the game like a certain kettle  despite not knowing why some of their supposed  fans  are like this.
as doctor ive read seen doctors talk to me about how the numbers of young girls coming with osteoporosis has dramatically increased due to these blockers and the other methods  that s disgusting
thank you for being a constant light in this world of celebrated crazy and you are 100  right with the nutrition.
this people are crazy for real  and extremely dangerous for little kids  if they refuse to embrace reality and seek help  we need to start shaming them everywhere... make shame great again people  they cross the line by miles.
well said
apparently  disagreeing with someone is now a hate crime. what a world.
i really would appreciate if they leave children the f    alone  you do you but leave them out of that let them enjoy their childhood in peace and let gamers enjoy their games. give respect if you want respect. enjoy the tears everyone!
thanks for calling out the crazies per usual melonie!
you won t abandon biology to focus on my feels! it s all so tiring
vivacious definition  lively  animated  spirited  esp. of a woman or girl . this juxtaposition of the artificial pale on the left of the screen and the real natural on the right side of the screen shows the true meaning of the word -- good work melonie!
think about the other forms of body dismorphya where people want fully functional limbs and appendages amputated  this validation leads to dark places quickly.
you were great on the drinker s podcast  keep speaking the truth
the best part about how stupidly angry they ve gotten over this game is how its making them show their true colors. they seem to have forgotten that they got all their power and influence by playing the meek little victims. but now  they have completely dropped all pretense and are blatantly bullying anyone that doesn t follow their cult. and since they are doing so with something as mainstream as hogwarts legacy  it has all been much more visible to the people that don t usually pay much attention to any of this.everyone saw them shoot themselves in the foot  so now one cares that they re crying about it  because its super obvious they aren t really the victims they always claim to be.
mel i love the attitude continue being awesome spicy truth teller you are.
eat a steak and lift some weights   lol i m dead.
for the love of god  eat a stake  i love it
if you think that s cringe worthy  check out wired s  review  of the game. they didn t even play it  they just trashed rowling s world. like...what !keep going with the live streams!  and speak more british!
the trans bullies are either denying or downplaying the harassment all over twitter  but some of us have screenshots to prove it. whenever i share the screenshots  they stop responding.
the irony of a trans person saying  just suck it up  and  you had to expect to get a little flack from it  when talking about people being harassed is absolutely insane.
as being an older male i seriously don t understand how today s society is working lol it s like if you re a man it s bad and if you re a woman it s bad... television is horrible now as all it does is push the agenda....hell they used to get upset when a lady showed some skin but it s  ok to show male on male or female on female scenes....we need more strong women like melonie that create good content and are not afraid to be themselves and speak the truth.... even as an older man i m so tired of seeing both men an women being cancelled like it s wrong to be who you are these days...keep up the good fight and go boom
i love how an ad for hl appeared immediately before this video.they re losing. and it s glorious.
these children with gender dysphoria need proper psychiatric care and a family evaluation long  long before any surgical hormonal treatments are considered. i have a niece who has autism and anxiety disorder  she was under extreme stress in her marriage and was considering having her breasts removed and hormone treatments to grow a beard and make herself into somthing in between and man and a woman  and she has two children. her relationship issue came to a head when everyone came down on her husband for trashing the house  not helping with household chores  drinking and smoking all day and sitting in online games. not only did his parents come down on him  but my sister  me  my wife  etc. he s changed his ways  and she has not mentioned the gender neutralization thing again  and according to my sister she is no longer considering it.
if you re woke you re a joke. it rhymes so it s true.
who in the world talks like this! this is absolutely exactly what happens when people don t love themselves and just focus on other stuff that s pointless
this whole hogwarts legacy canceling thing have been hilarious since the start. that the game is a best seller  top streamed and  the fact the game is amazingly good give me so much joy.  i really want to play this game  and i m not even a potter fan in any way  though i thought the movies was ok enough. only thing the game is missing is a cameo of j.k rollings just to put the final nail in for the massively fail boycott and canceling.
so u feel harrassed  suck it up  and they wonder why no body likes them.....
at this point troons are just background noise...but i am impressed that the personal mo-cap technology has gotten so good.
a vtuber embarrassed himself so bad it s kinda what we do   _   _
rowling was homeless  had absolutely nothing. now she is rich and successful  and i am a fan of her work. i am happy for her  and she deserves every accolade she gets for the rest of her life. everyone that has read her books got to escape whatever hell they were living for a little while  and that is a service to humanity.
that whole rant from the vtuber was like a gold star in mental gymnastics lol  how the heck did we end up on capitalism from the starting argument   wow!
i guy who repeated a lie until he rewrote his own nueropsychological functionality  not just to a point where he gave himself a lisp  but to the level of fully denying reality  is the step beyond becoming a pathological liar called sociopathy where regardless of the consequences  he will continue engaging in the chosen course of action.
mel trying to make her own jiggle physics work
gotta admit  i always feel great after a nice meaty meal... and after an exhausting workout... and after a logical rational argument where one side learned something - even if often so far that side was me... and i don t even see myself as specifically very masculine. i m just an average dude.
want to watch bad youtubers  watch zoomer
she was never homeless lol look it up. rowling has put the rumors to rest  saying in a commencement speech given to harvard graduates that she was forced to live off state welfare  explaining   an exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded  and i was jobless  a lone parent  and as poor as it is possible to be in modern britain  without being homeless.   just google some things. i never read the books  the art cover was the most disgusting art style to me. yes  i judged a book by its cover  most do. the movies however  were my childhood.
i thought she lived off of welfare
@madison crum  oh  damn that was a widespread rumor because everyone i knew at least believed the same. thanks for clarifying.
@madison crum  i suggest you give the books a shot they are great.
12 21  lmao epic reaction  the disgust in her face before she starts
this is what happens when you give a man too much soy   lol you re right on the money melonie  masculinity is needed in this world for structure  without it we ll fall apart
it never would have crossed my mind that goblins were like j.  it never occurred to me that orcs were b either but some people saw orcs and saw b and then called the rest of us r for not seeing it.
great takes on all of this mess and how it contradicts the bible. most recently read the book of jude and it felt like a direct response to something like the grammys. thanks for sharing.
trans kids do not exist. instantly subbed
just cry in to the cupanyone else been genuinely laughing for like 3 days straight  because this is too sweet
what a stunning and brave inflection in his voice....
had an argument with one of these freaks a few days ago. after 20 mins of trying to defend bullying people for playing a game she realised she can t win  she was out of arguments so she deleted all the comments  including mines  most satisfying win ever
i m worried melonie is a  water phobic  please drink some water. hahaha stay safe. take care. have fun.
learn to fish!  is going to be my new thing to say to people instead of  go touch grass.  lmao love it.
was great to see you chatting it up with the critical drinker hope to see it again soon
you can t really destroy the harry potter franchise. it s fanbase is far too large and far too loyal. this fight was over before it even began. personally i can t wait to play hogwarts legacy. sadly i m still on ps4 though so my pre-order won t arrive until april. it ll be worth it though.
there is a reason companies like hololive have a  do not say  list.
you go girl!
they even bullied v streamer tuber pikemee. another innocent streamer because hogwarts legacy so bad that she hasn t streamed for almost few days now.
eat a steak and lift some weights  did we just become best friends!!
i bought the game for my trans sibling  she loved it. we grew up with harry potter  it means a lot to us  so we re not gonna let some weirdos on twitter tell us what to do. f em
i knew people were delusional but i genuinely dont understand how they can think this is okay
i do agree with the weirdo that people should expect blowback and suck it up when it comes. best thing to do is to say  no  to these people and ignore them. they ve proven they can t handle that.
he s the physical manifestation of the word  prius
bahaha!
what s your twitch
she sweet heart why bully teapot
yeah it sucks. they have fun streaming  wanna share that experience with their viewers  and know their viewers would love to watch them play it  so they try to stream the game  but then get waste of space losers like these twitter idiots ruining the experience. idk how most streamers dealt with the situation  i ll play way later cause no money for it atm so i m avoiding spoilers from streams  but i d have switched to subs only mode  slow chat  and tell my mods to go nuts with the ban hammer. xd
woke western vtuber doesn t represent most vtuber people look at hololive kson nijisanji jp and other smaller agency.
everytime i hear one of their rants i always wonder how they draw these conclusions  like  way out of left field there buddy.
i remember a time when a girl could be a tomboy. you know  one of the guys  and that was accepted. they were still girls! and no need to cut of body parts or go on hormone blockers. some girls just liked boy stuff more. fine  no troubles. now... well the first signs of parents feeling their choice to force kids to go through gender  therapy  and  reassignment  is coming in a big wave.
06 19  are you hungry  gasp  that s anophobic biggitry!
4 47 i ve been thinking about that for ages. in the name of  erasing stigma   we ve started celebrating and encouraging mental disorders. look  i ve got ocd. if i started celebrating it by freely compulsing after every obsession  instead of working against it  i d become howard hughes.
no one on tweeter has won a argument against me when it came to hogwarts legacy and they always want to run away when i tell them the truth
i love the whole  f@scist  thing these people    keep trying to use... while not understanding that all f@scist dictatorships were  wait for it ... socialist. this is according to their own politics  from their own speeches  and actual policies...  and yes that includes tiny mustache man.
eat a steak and lift some weights   ahahahah true that  sister!
cry into the cup.. im thirsty  - savage azz biatch
i agree with you melonie  some oatmeal  eggs  beef and jesus can improve these peoples lives dramatically. keep up the good work and keep voicing the truth.
unfortunately there are groups out to encourage people giving themselves eating disorders with catch phrases like the hunger pain will pass remember your target size and that get you through granted these groups are not terribly common but they exist on facebook and reddit
i feel like each video  you literally speak my mind out loud
vtubers going mainstream in 2020 sadly also meant that it would attract the wrong kinds of people.
the jiggle physics had me dying.
i bought it and streamed last night keep it up lady.
one hundred percent to everything you laid out here in this video.. the cognitive dissonance in our current society is completely bonkers
preach it sister!!
i think people who are thinking of streaming this game should do it as a charity streams   having it blatantly obviousin the tittle of the streams and placed on the screenthat way people who come into the chat to be hatefulwill just look sad side note- people should just report-block the people who areattacking people for playing the game since most sites it s in the terms of service harassment is a big no   noand can lead to suspension of the account
the red meat thing is indeed real
if they think you should shut up about being harassed then maybe they should take their own advice it s impossible to sympathize with hypocrites
how is that transphobic    gasp  that too in transphobic!
but but but socialism is all about helping people! you must be a fascist because you say mean things about socialism
why i know feeling after witch from mercy started and lot those weirdos joining already demand changes now
vtubers going mainstream is sad in itself
vtubing lets you portray yourself however you want  so it makes sense that trans people would be drawn to it.
@jeff w  have you ever watched vtubers before  there are people who would say the same thing about d d  anime or videogames. it could also be considered sad that adults are playing games like hogwarts legacy or pok mon.
it s only en vtubers that are all terrible and start drama except the popular ones like mori calliope that knows how to act and do very good with her fanbase.
@hunt  then you re watching the wrong en vtubers. most of them just want to have fun.
i mean i want to do vtuber  but as a dude i want to design a dude vtuber cause you know im fucking normal xd
@lark88  yea when you thought a vtuber was chill until they show their two-face side. have you seen the drama a while back with nux when ironmouse and others threw him under the bus
@hunt  i m well aware of it. it was a disagreement in tactics dealing with a scammer and both parties made mistakes of which they have apologized. i also know that both parties just want to move on.
@lark88  you know why the girls had to apologize because he was bigger than all of them and he made them more popular and known throughout the world  why bite at the hand that feeds you huh  if they they didn t apologize you know what what ve happen. even though i do respect nux  he can be very naive.
@hunt  this was over a year ago. it s time to let it go.
@lark88 10 months ago and i already past on that but i referenced it to show how fake these people are  they re still the same people who can backstab you so that s not something you can forget about.
they just can t take the l. and how the heck could you take a person behind a anime character seriously lol
i got banned from a stream on twitch for even mentioning hogwarts. been supporting her channel for 5 years as well. twitch is becoming too political and woke.
i wonder if you got to the point in the game where the trans character actually complains her  his  colleagues at hogwarts misgendered her  him
i agree with everything you said 100
last time i was this early  aaron rodgers could at least make it to the nfc championship game.
winning an arguments against a genius is hardwinning an argument against an idiot is impossible
those who claim they stand against hate turns out to be the most hateful monsters at anyone who do not blindly agree with them like sheep.
eat some meat  tbh i think he may already be getting his fair share.
second video of yours i watch. well subscribe earned because you are a very reasonable person and you can express it with fines  d
finally some one willing to say it.
ironic saying  suck it up  when that thing is the one offended
it s sad to see people with a legitimate mental issue who are trying to do what they can to get on with their lives being pushed aside by men who want to normalise their kink.
wow this video actually made me subscribe to you i completely agree with you about these animals
i ve never seen you before and i now hate the algorithms for not showing me you sooner. girl....women like you are beyond rare.....at least in my experience. ya give guys hope that just maybe some women actually.....like and respect men as well as women  like.....its sad that i have to praise you for being.....rational but it really is rare. i m 42. lol. just so you have perspective on how long i ve been dealing with people. this shvt is nuts.
omfg i finally found someone who has the exact same opinion about this whole topic as me!
melony you are so dang pretty. keep exposing these damn fools.
i just saw a video of a born woman taking testosterone to be more manly almost crying because now she s experiencing male pattern baldness. like its really thinning out. so much now she is shaving her head. people really need to be fully aware of what becoming a man is all about when playing chemist with your body. let me say i do not hate or fear any trans person. i only wish them the best. it s just a very risky project to mess with nature.
eat a steak and lift some weights!  melanie out here dropping some truth bombs. you should put that on a line of t-shirts!
this just makes me want to get the game more
man what a strange world we are living in
looool
i used to live in minneapolis  that made me smile as a former rival.
@lvthor ascending  sadly i remember the vikings vs cardinals in week 17 a long time ago. should have more defensive players in the end zone
@ancestor empire  dude the last few years they get it right until it counts  then they flop like crazy. i m in texas now so i m supporting better teams lol.
@lvthor ascending  how packers fans must feel when detroit has a better record than them.
@ancestor empire  yep  love seeing the packers team being more trash than the whole city of detroit.
@lvthor ascending  another fun fact  rex grossman and aaron rodgers have the same amount of super bowl appearances.
@ancestor empire  lol  is rex still playing  haven t heard the name in ages. i m sure rodgers is having a blast barely being on par with the vikings  that gray hair is really coming in.
@lvthor ascending  nope for a long time. lmao
well she got what she wanted!!! just wait till all this  trans women  hit their 30 s and experience it too
so testosterone causes baldness i thought that was a genetic thing
i am sure all the big redneck muscle boys already have those shirts as well as the  i eat twice as much meat to protest vegans its honestly just cringey dude
@chandller burse i wouldnt have expected arthur morgan to say something like that
@chandller burse  i mean i could be wrong but i dont think he d say  cringe  which is what i was talking about
@client hacks  i mean obviously but what other word is fitting for it  its exactly what it is and always was.also i never choose to be called or constantly talked about for my pfp but people do it all the time which is honestly kind of odd since it seems no one else says anything similar about a different persons pfp of another popular character lol.
preach sister!!! beard approved!
i was trying to formulate a question regarding v-tubers  but all i can come up with is...   why    i think that covers it.
these people are forgetting that becoming trans is almost always a choice  and forcing their life style on others. as adults we just ignore them  but if you force it on kids  your own children included  its bad.
there is nothing wrong with cereal and beer.  you can t tell people to do what they want with their time and money and then tell them what they can and cannot eat and drink.
there s so much to unpack with this failed male right here.i can t wait for this game to come to the ps4 so i can finally play it myself! gotta show that ravenclaw power.
we need to start reporting these people for harassment . it s essentially what they are doing.
happy friday melonie mac! enjoyed you on the mario kart stream this past monday with dan vasc  rippa  lady rippa and g g! please return to mario kart again with g g  dan vasc  rippa and lady rippa pls!have a great weekend and great upcoming valentines week!
stopped by from the quartering channel. your truth resonates here! you got my sub. i ll join your channel shortly. i appreciate your courage   honesty immensely. blessed be!
you guys better get ready  vtubers will be the next  marginalized  group who will be crying for acceptance
i m actually curious what the dude looks like behind the virtual character. i m sure it would explain a lot more. these people just need to get a grip on reality  and realize that the world doesn t revolve around them.
interesting point about learning how to hunt...i ve never encountered someone who also ran away from snakes while trying to hunt deer  or in our case hogs  to concern themselves a vtuber trying to talk down about a video game that is inclusive...because of something not transphobic the creator of said world we play said game is set in.........also just as a side-note...my wife and her dad s birthdays are within 2 weeks of each other...they both wanted steak. i ve been drowning in red meat and loving every bit of it!!
out of all languages  decided to speak facts
in a campaign to stop bullying  they them bully everyone who plays a video game made primarily for children....makes total sense
they re telling us to suck it up when they re crying about a video game
me  sees the results of a grain soy-based diet me   looks like meat s back on the menu  boys!
let them get mad. i can t wait to stream it this weekend. i made a twitch account just for this game.
you can clearly tell the sane vtubers over the not so sane ones eh!  as a fan of many legit don t know this one but going after pikamee is so messed up she s so precious! a little harmless kettle dayo!others i follow are streaming the game  hope these toxic type don t go after them and calm down!
if they think the goblins is racist...let s hope they don t find out that world of warcraft exists.
this is so goddamn refreshing
notice how that vtuber is laughing after finishing a sentence  it s angry laughter
i don t even like harry potter but i think it s cool that this game is topping the charts.
i bet normal regular women are pissed and tired of hearing a grown ass man  especially one dressed as a women  telling other women what s best for them   no pun intended
i wish people would respect each other and stop with the hate towards each other  and stop the bullying  calling people mental ill and all that bs  it s all agendas that people want to fight over and is pushed into anything   i think everyone is mental ill because of media and being brainwashed  like stupid tiktok videos and people doing stupidity things!!
this is what you get when you feed men a bunch of soy.  hehe  love it.
i love how i m listening to this video.....while playing hogwarts legacy! goty contender for me but i m a pretty big megaman battle network fan so the legacy collection might take that spot - who knows.
my man needs to take his own advice and  shut up  and suck it up.
as delicious as those tears are to read sometimes  stay away from twitter till you beat the game cause theyre starting to retweet spoilers.
for the love of glob eat a steak and lift some weights  lol
the worst part is that i know most of these folks are still gonna play the game anyway  it s all one big virtue signal.
it s awesome hearing this .   liked and subed
you get people like this vtuber when they stop bullying in schools.
this is why i m terrified about my daughter going to public schools.
i had people unfollow me on twitter just for posting pc screenshots of my hogwarts legacy deluxe edition. people that i was cool with for years. fickle!
i do like listening to your videos keep up the good work
game is amazing so far! don t let the woketators get to you.yes i mixed woke with dictator
at this point just ignore them  let them bark and hide behind the internet. they are cowards. they re not bullying  idk what you call telling people to talk to death early  just ignore them  let them take each other down.
the devs get bonus pay based on the sales of the game. a lot of the time  their base pay is really bad because they are banking on their 5 years of hard work to pay off.
in the fact that they re done it they want validation shouldn t give them anything because that where this starts lo u give them what they want they come back wanting more
lol melonie i absolutely love your channel.i certainly hopeyour going to have wonderful weekend
i agree with almost everything you said except the red meat part. been vegetarian pretty much all my life  meat to me is just very unappetizing. for someone who  eats a lot of soy   fake meat products  my test levels are normal
falsely accusing people of bullying is the new form of bullying. they are the bullies  but like for real they are literally the bullies  im not trying to be ironic.
it s sad about all the brain washing  but if you can be a good role model and teach your daughter well  i have no doubt she ll be okay in a public school.
@client hacks  that s what my fianc e and i are trying to do. teach her good lessons  morals and such and pray she ll be good
yet these people will freak out if somebody harasses them. or him. whatever
nice to see a fellow hufflebuff fight the good fight  flex
idk why their mob can t see sense in pretty much everything you re saying here. a lot of people saying this stuff out in the open because it s gotten to a point where ppl are going  hangon  wtf  can we keep a grip on reality  . i see the reality-side of the discussion open to hear and respond to their arguments  but they mostly just scream and froth rather than actually respond properly.
how would it be if we started celebrating eating disorders   we are celebrating eating disorders. more specifically  we re celebrating obesity  under the guise of  body positivity.  people like lizzo are doing this. there are reality tv shows and content creators who celebrate this.
the woke salt is the perfect salt for my popcorn
i listened to this while playing hogwarts legacy
you popped up on my algorithm and i m not disappointed  this video got you a new sub! pleasure to meet ya!
for the love of god do something different  lmao
moona from hololive id has been killing it lol. shes been streaming the game nonstop
to be fair toxic masculinity is definitely a real thing besides your example of it but it s 100  not what these swj types think it is. they should try working in the trades if they think the men they deal with are toxic.also anyone know who the 15 34 reference was to
hahahahahaha you gotta see the notes for the empress crack torrent for the game. she ripped on the people hating jk rowling and troons...the funniest part is i saw a bunch of troon and their  allies  who said they will just wait for it to get cracked by empress .because they seemed to think she was on their side . i wanna see their reaction after seeing that
keep fighting the fight. it gives me hope that the entirety of the younger generations are not totally lost. i subscribed when the quartering originally recoomended your brand new channel. like seeing on the drinkers live streams as well. i do drink beer  also eat meat  and will give my life defending my family. desert storm veteran.
that giggle is the giggle of a coomer ghoul
hogward s legacy is a win-win situation. win because we get an amazing game delivered  i love it so far. and a win because it s exposing to the general audiences how exclusive  dangerous and evil the woke ideology truly is  and it is proving that those violent intolerant fanatics have no influence on the success or the failure of a game. i hope companies will take note of how marginal those dangerous brainwashed idiots are  and that they will start to ignore their useless harassement campaigns in the future.
there is no other type of v-tuber than cringe ones. ugh
the people making these conspiracy theories are just like the parents that tried to cancel pokemon back when it first came out for being related to the devil.
so this guy wants people to support him and his activism. yet  he hates himself so much he can t even stomach having his own face on camera.  yes please support me and my cause . even though i have zero confidence in myself.
the biggest reason this movement and attempted boycott got the attention it did was because it was the only movement these people could participate in and execute from the safety of their beds. i can guarantee if they had to go walk or drive somewhere to protest  they would have stayed at home and raged over twitter about being marginalized.
i have to imagine that every one of these hater chumps were lined up for the movies in their hogwart robes and wands with aspirations to be harry potter. spoiler  they all became voldemort.
they already do celebrate eating disorders when they go plus sized... only a matter of time...
hey  melonie i just want to tell you that those haters are trying to be in charge of destroying our freedom and love of the hogwarts video game but we as gamers will not let them destroy our lives of loving this cool   rad hogwarts video game  ok melonie. anyway i just want to tell you that and i just want to tell you that i enjoy watching you on twitch as you play hogwarts video game on wednesday and yesterday  thursday . anyway i just want to tell you that and i just want to tell you that you are doing a fantastic job with making these videos for your fans like me and everyone else who follows you on your youtube boom channel   twitter and twitch. anyway i just wanted to tell you that  ok melonie. hope you had a great blessed day today at home and hope you had fun with playing hogwarts video game too today on twitch. anyway hope you have a great blessed evening at home and with your family and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great weekend too melonie.go chiefs !!!!!!
people are actually losing their damn mind over wizard game xdlike y all  we have been way too long on the internet we need to pull the plug.
his voice sounds a lot like the organized chaos who debated rippa
i lived to see people crying over buying a video game lol
i randomly found that vtubers twitch channel last night. i find it funny you did a video on this vtuber.
thanks too the wokeness i brought  hogwarts legacy an i m not even a harry potter fan i only seen the first movie but i love the game there s no doubt it going be the game of the year hands down i think the only game will get them a competition this year would be spider-man 2
that dude is creepy af
my feelings are so hurt! i m gonna go play legacy now!
1 37 - 2 00   melonie 100  describing the mass majority of the alphabet set.
i m incredibly anti-christian but outside of that i m basically with you girl lol this shits insane lately
ever thought of doing a political news channel  i think you d be phenomenal!
life heavy thing  make sad voice in head go away
thank you as always!!
at this point asking to try to support the boycott is like asking people to swim back to the titanic.
they re going around posting spoilers on ads on fb. i called one out and they are literally spamming my main page with attacks as we speak.
i was born in 94 and i remember when anorexia was trendy and how bad it got. this ligbit stuff is the same except for two main things and those are the crazies that were allowed a spot to speak and the emotionally driven millennials that allowed them to get up there. now it s gotten as bad as it is here when  from the looks of things back in the beginning 10s and the 2ks  things were going a pretty fine way.
don t feed the trollsdont feed the delusionals
hogwarts legacy is currently overwhelmingly positive on steam with a 95  score!
word  3 you are what woke used to mean! god bless
you know who else wants to destroy hogwarts  he who shall not be named  v . wonder if he s an  ally
tbh the people refusing to stream this game are proving that bullying exists and that it is from the community that is supposedly welcoming and excepting
ha! i remember that clown. that goofy fool blocked me just for sayin  reeeeeeeee
this is what happens when your dad and mom doesnt beat you into the correct way to grow up lol xd imma sub for this video xd
what gets me is the game s character creation has no gender allocations  no appearance restrictions  no race restrictions. you can be feminine faced asian wizard that dresses in masculine clothes with long green hair a beard and a high pitched voice. i haven t seen anyone point this out.on another point you talked about  the most toxic masculinity i have ever encountered was from a lesbian who thought she was embodying what it is to be a man. rude  angry  bolshie  argumentative and generally unlikeable.
12 26 eat a steak  and lift some weight. i laughed off my chair
10 18 this has been debunked many times  game devs do get pay extra depending on the sales of the game and also it founds future projects of the company but of course this person blocked everyone who call out that.
lmao  cry into the cup. i need refreshment  i gotta wait till april to play im missing out on all the hate
i mean its a great game and imho lives up to the hype been playing now since the 7th and i honestly cant stop playing
thanks to this boycott more people are playing the game  enjoying the setting  and becoming new fans of harry potter.
when a girl accutally have a father
mel is a baddie  3
is it just me  or do v tubers with male voices tend to cackle   hehehe you know  hehehe
just try to imagine being a man using an avatar of an anime girl w white hair and jiggly fun bags to put out a message online  and that was supposed to save you from the embarrassment and criticism of showing your actual face.
oh my word  that voice  oh my goodness was it irritating  just to be clear the creepy video game character avatar user is who i m referring to .  that alone was getting on my nerves  and this whole situation  about that game is just so stupid.  i m glad you re making great videos based on it  that s at least one positive.  i really like the perspective you give  it s important to realize that the emperor has no clothes  meaning we can t just stand on a foundation that isn t really there. even that aside  to assume authority over someone and say they can or can t do anything is not only arrogant but baseless because who are they to tell us how we should be   their whole reasoning is objectively flawed as they violate what i m assuming is their surface theology  they demand we not judge them but then they judge us for not buying into this stuff.  then wouldn t that technically make them  phobic  of us by not accepting us based on the surface guidelines of their own philosophy   but there it is   surface philosophy   all anyone usually cares about when they buy a cake is the frosting.  they put up a front  but behind that front is something far worse than what they accuse their opposition of  an ironic parallel to one of the worst events ever to happen in the early 20th century.i speak in metaphors a lot  sorry if i wrote too much  that s a lot of my dad s influence probably.  great video  keep it up  as always!!!
i am not against people using virtual avatars or  vtubing ....but that was super bizarre...
my ex suffers from that kind of stuff. she says she hates being seen as feminine and it kinda kills me inside.
imagine watching the movie with your friend and they go  why do those goblins have so much in common with jews   you d think they were rasict af lol. i will never understand them..
this behavior will continue until the npcs receive their update to support new current thing
it s a shame that all of this hate comes from just playing a video game...
i don t go to a gym  but i do ride my bike regularly. can t really do that right now though.
why would you even admit that you fail as a man so bad that your ex instinctively feels the need to compensate for your lack of manliness by becoming less feminine
@horsemen4deth i never thought that it would be a non-liberal who ended up being the biggest snowflake.
just purchased the game  and don t care for all the negativity of others. just a gamer by the end of the day. don t care where the money goes  if someone dislikes their views  labeling bullying shaming ect  it s sad that this is the reality we re faced with that i d rather escape into games that these devs put their imaginative thoughts into.
people are getting very fed up with woke scolds telling them what to say   do   spend their money time on etc that changes constantly.  it should have happened years ago but at least more and more people are becoming defiant.
the game s so fricking good. and i don t care if people don t want us to say it.
watched a few streams and forums with people spoiler bombing. these people are so horrible. i hope everyone remembers this when they ask for support in the future. lots of moderate people have lost respect for the trans community after this.
that vtuber has a groomer vibe.
the whole  black people are orcs  thing has always amazed me. i ve played dnd since i was like 11 years old  not once have i ever thought orcs were black people. weird.
when the comments are turned off you know the person already got folded
anna rex sounds like an awesome name for a female roller derby
the funniest thing about the whole argument from the haters  is you can actually make trans characters in the game..... it doesn t stop you creating a female body type and giving it a male voice and calling it a wizard  or visa versa. you d have thought they d have been all over that for including those options  but haters gunna hate
gee  with a voice like that  i wonder what the vtuber really looks like. i am completely puzzled by this.
they  the transtenders. i like that term  gonna steal it  or appropriate it  should i say  are pushing this down everyone s throat so much  till people are so sick of it  they lash out at it. and  then they scream victim.as far as the jewish  goblin argument goes  is it any surprise at all. the left enbody racism . and  that cartoon is cringe. soy should be illegal for men. and  btw  you got my sub today. i m onboard with your view points  one and all.
i m gonna stream hogwarts in hopes that these people see it to complain on my stream
the argument   the devs have been paid . no  they haven t. it isn t just the individual devs that make money on the games  but the studios as well. most studios have to take out a loan during the development process and recoup that from sales. these people irritate me to no end with their confidence in being wrong.
i m enjoying the game so far and the tears of the haters
that voice sounds like sirona ryan s  not gonna lie.
this vtuber sounded like what i thought they would sound like and hit all the talking points i figured they would and when melonie hit play it just confirmed it. this is getting so boring  from an argument standpoint  as you know what they are going to say before they even say it  and they wonder why people call them npc s...
cry into the cup  lmao
a steak and a workout sounds loverly.
i see cringe v-tuber ratio d and my first thought is what did lofti do now  really happy even his bad takes don t go this far.
tell me you look like a drag time story time person without telling me your a drag time story time person.
haters gonna hate playas gonna play.... as harry the boy who s magical stream lives!!!
fatherless vtuber energy
just got the game today and it s downloading right now can t wait to play it.
imagine if people would go to the streams of gay games or gay lets play and bombard them like they are doing.  everyone would be banned and it would make headlines.  but trans-activist can get away with harassment.   and 100  agree  the most toxic men i ve deal with are the feminine one.  and as someone part of the alphabet soup community. i ve hang a lot with gay guys.  and the toxic ones are far worst than any sexist toxic masculine one. and coming from an old fashion catholic town i ve dealt with quite a bit of those.
i can t wait to get out of this shadow realm.
my response to this person you showed on twitter is just  cry harder.
ahh yes  salty hater tears really are the best after a nice workout  d
i m just sitting here in my 30s thinking of how i would explain what a v-tuber is to my grandmother.... and  tbh... i don t think it would be possible.
go eat a steak .
what s really funny is that in game you are referred to as they them most times it s like their argument is unfounded even at the core of the game and how you interact with it. plus jk rowling as far as i know has little to no involvement with game. i guess dumb twitter people be dumb twitter people
avalanche should make a hogwart s brew energy drink watch those guys really cringe hard
i ve never had any real interest in the harry potter franchise. this was a game that but for all the  controversy  would never have even been on my radar. but because of it  i ve actually watched a lot of gameplay and it looks like a lot of fun and i may now actually end up picking it up.
if my schizophrenic grandpa thinks he is superman i am not going to make everyone call him superman and take him on top of buildings to test his flying skills
until hogwarts legacy came out  i had never once in my life ever heard anyone call goblins jews lol
this is just making me want to buy the game for just for the sake off pissing these chronically online gremlins off
be careful these psychopaths are spoiling the ending. i didn t get the whole thing spoiled but they spoiled one part of the end for me    why would you ruin someone elses harry potter experience like that lol
melonie  i m watching this the night before going grocery shopping.what do you recommend as a replacement for cereal    i haven t had cereal for sometime now and i was craving it
i am going to be extremely disappointed if we do not get tiktoks or youtube videos of people screaming at kids at a gamestop or walmart electronics section for just wanting the game it would show that this whole boycott is more a fight for attention than a fight for rights. because this anime thing is absolutely reaching for attention.
i don t understand why these people seem to always act like these marginalized ppl are monoliths.
100  support what you re saying
maybe ask your grandmother something about her life instead of boring her with yours
@lingr icen  she s been dead for 20 years  i was thinking outloud about the absurdity of things. what a passive aggressive response.  lol
@mooseot  no sonny  now is your chance to finally ask
i just got it today. played around 3 and a half hours and i m really enjoying it
the final boss battle is epic
eggs  bacon  sausage  etc. make meat and eggs your main food source and you ll be doing better than most
that thing sounds like someone that would complain.
i just laugh at anyone that calls me  ist  or  phobe  anything and thank them for living in a fantasy world instead of the real world with the rest of us.
i have to wait until april for the ps4 release i can not wait to play this game by avalanche studios!!
remember to eat a steak every once in a while fellas
puberty blockers side effects include brain swelling  spinal damage and weakened skeletal structure. it s been banned in a lot of countries in europe
do youtube long enough  and you will end up arguing with an elf puppet in real time.
know thy enemy i think the radicals are following that principal for almost all -isms. the ones who are most vocal against certain -isms and see them everywhere had to have been doing those -isms themselves to know what they are  and are hypocritically abusing that now that someone listens.
im betting many of the  haters  are hypocrites and even secretly love the game.
i just wanna be a wizard and do wizardy tings
now i m craving steak!
never heard that term before but its very true  trans trenders
love you sis i see you getting more bolder with your words the children of god should be fearless just like you re being god bless and stay safe
i ve been vegan for almost 10 years now  and feel very masculine and manly  and it s not just my own perception... i think the problem comes from another sources. it s a socio-environmental issue.it s cultural. it s of course nutritional too  but not the biggest problem mel. it s mainly the education and culture.
when you disable comments on twitter you ve already lost.
this v tuber is a perfect example of what happens when capitalism makes your life so good that you have all your basic needs satisfied and a person searches for purpose by latching onto this woke crusade.
hii. trans person here. i just want to say thank you for this video. subscribed
i don t see what the problem is  me and my husban love this game!
these people are trying to dismantle the traditional values of the family unit by normalising otherwise aberrant behaviour  then attacking those who defend these said values
i looked early today and there were over 500 streams of this game on twitch. they took a big l on this one. i bought two copies of the game to support women s rights
he can t mind his own business - he has no business  no thoughts  no hobbies  no deeper thoughts. his universe revolves around sexuality  his and everybody else s. there s no room for anything else.
the joy of owning a ps4
ok brocoli
@lingr icen  hahahaha nice one
@edwin fern ndez  ty i ll leaf you alone now
damn i like you  you re like the girl version of charli  in a sense
this is what happend when you feed too many men soy  - this was very funny! thank you!
i so hope that v-tuber software this dude uses in developed from somebody with skeletons in their closet.. not that i advocate bad things but the irony would be perfect
haters can hate all they want  noone other than you have the right to tell you what you can   cant play  this person isnt helping their case by posting this cringe  i get the feeling they are just doing this for attention  thats all. i ve seen the gameplay of hogwarts legacy   i do plan to play it at some point.
literally this is the first i ve heard about goblins are apparently jews  seriously  nobody ever thought that. that is disgraceful  that they think that is a thing.   the world is ruined. keep up the great content!!
good grief that was scary and creepy dudes
i have little interest in anything harry potter related but i will buy this game just because. and who knows  i may like it after all
he s so stunning  and brave........hiding behind an anime character. also  there s more in the environment that is affecting testosterone levels in men. atrizine  the active ingredient in round-up   polychlorinated biphenyls  and the chemicals  used in the manufacturing of plastic bottles  are endocrine disrupters  as well as estrogen mimickers. these are all parts of a massive biological and chemical war that is being waged on human fertility  masculinity  femininity  and western civilization  as a whole. who s behind it  well  the public face of it is the world economic forum but there is a much darker  and dare i say it  luciferian influence that is the guiding hand in this parade of atrocities. keep callin  em  like you see  em  miss melonie! in the end  god wins!
are you sure that s a male voice  his ball s haven t dropped then mel  how is your mental health  my depression has gone since i started keto
to my understanding  gender affirming care or bottom surgery isn t performed to individuals under the age of 18. look it up the people who are self mutilating themselves for making that decision themselves once they are over 18.
its more hilarious because they are complaining about this game but they got a smart phone and clothes probably made through child labor
if they want to call people names  then two can play that game. if you re for targeting children for this  you re a groomer.
a huge push back needs to happen. it has gone from human rights  which everybody deserves  to wanting special privilege and attacking anybody who doesn t kiss the ground they walk on
judge me by the enemies i have made.  -  marcus aurelius judge a person by the reputation of their enemies.   -  arabian proverb
i ve never understood people who  love  being trans - but it s fine  it s their life. myself  i wish i never ever had to think about my gender and just live happily as i was born. i don t hate myself for being trans  but i hate having to live with this condition that affects every facet of my life. but just saying this about your own experiences and feelingswill attract people who find some kind of names to call you  and it s always coming from know-it-all ultra-liberals
its funny  today i went to my friend s house. he has this parrot  you see. as i approached the bird  i said  speak! and the bird immediately cackled   squawk! there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. squawk!  i guess my friend has been watching too many videos about this  controversy  -.-
as a dev  that argument the devs have been paid is idiotic.
fun fact jk rowling already got paid  whether you buy the damned game or not. they paid her for the rights. at best  she is getting like 3 cents a copy of the game that sells.it s funny watching someone whose entire personality is them playing make believe  telling others what they are allowed to make believe.
bet that guy has pretty sus material on his pc  my spidey senses are going  wee woo wee woo
jazz one of the first transgender girls i knew from an early age came out and started to transition when she was young.  transgender is real and people whom are born in the wrong body need to try and care for their physical and mental states
@neil davis  not always it depends on ones argument too.
trans-trenders omfg that is the single best way to describe this new fad.
he has an internet connrction  access to streaming platforms  and the ability to makes himself look like an anime girl online.those don t sound like food  shelter  or clothing to me. does he really think his computer  his internet  his software  his recording devices  etc were all 100  ethically made  by his own logic  he should donate all his electronics and stay offline.
if these people do not want to be part of a free market  they can always become subsistence farmers on a commune.
who is this gal  i like her... never seen her or her channel before i m glad the algorithm sent her my way
many are the strange vicissitudes of history. greatness has often sunk to the dust  and has tempered itself to it s new surroundings. smallness has risen aloft  has flourished for a time  and then has sunk once more. rich monarchs have become poor monks. brave conquerers have lost their manhood. eunuchs and women  have overthrown armies and kingdoms     if we but transpose  women  with  feminists   and  eunuchs  with  transgenders   then  in the immortal words of sir arthur conan doyle  thus went the west
just commenting to help the reach. keep it up buddy.
what is funny to me is that if i were to say a woman who wants to be a man or a man who wants to be a woman offends me  then i m a bigot  racist  and so on.  but  if anything offends them personally  then they are the victim.
i cannot believe that the creators of hogwarts legacy and jk rowling would do something so controversial. it is entirely unacceptable in 2023 to have these views and they deserve all the hate they get. i will be refunding this game and boycotting it to spread awareness. it is inhumane and downright demeaning that they make you play as a british person. -a steam review
i love every vtuber.except this one.
i know nothing about harry potter. never read the books  never watched the movies. don t know anything about jk rowling. never read her tweets. could not care less about her opinions. all i know is i m a wizard in a world of magic riding a hippogriff. probably the best open world rpg i ve played since witcher 3.
at least pay good money for the jiggle physics. got that dollar store physics
see don t blame cereal for this madness because i love it and am far from these individuals lmao
here is a good joke  making fun of transgendered  and is also a warning. a man goes to a job review. on his application  he put he is a transman. he is asked questions about how he became a transman. this is what happened the interviewer  so  when did you know you were a man the guy stated  well  i was born into the world in a man s body  with a female soul. i love women  so i decided to trans into a man. the interviewer responds  well  that just makes you a man.the guy responded  i am transgendered. i am a transman  that is a lesbian.the interviewer responds  that just makes you a man. that just makes you a man.the guy  that is transphobia.the interviewer  okay  your hired.the guy thinking to himself  this was an easy win for a normal born male.the funny part is the guy got the male using the insane system to get a job. the warning part is that this can actually work and get the guy into places where a man should not get into.
already pre-ordered for the x-bone.
the  safe space  people are openly encouraging the harassment of others...for playing a game.  imagine what they d encourage if it were something actually serious.  what we re seeing from this is a little preview of how dangerous these people would be if they had the power that they want.  they wouldn t just be encouraging and justifying harassment...
there is literally a trans character in the game. you can even make your character trans.
if you do is do you plan on making about hogworkz legacy this is literally your first video on the subject at this point it feels like looking it.
what is wild about this is they are calling it  that wizard game   but if we are to use their same logic  they are inadvertently referencing the source material within the same context of  he who shall not be named  which is hypocritical and ironic...
that goblin jew connection is an onion video
imagine if they  haters of hl  bothered to play the game and discovered that a helpful character is voiced by a transwoman.  dramatic gasping
doesn t matter if you love cereal  it was created to lower testosterone in boys and it worked. sad reality  but it isn t healthy lol
@melonie mac go boom  well if that s the case it must not have worked on me lol
this is like my  8th video on hogwarts legacy lol
they are playing the game covertly.
it seems that all this trans-activism has been pushing me more and more to lose empathy for trans people and see them as threats rather then people. i try to hold on to my compassion for all people  but they re making it hard.
i m enjoying the game so much it s a beautiful game. my wife is a huge fan and she got me into the series. the activists just make every minute of playing even better knowing people are losing their minds over someone playing a video game. it s not that deep also people are so afraid to be cancelled with the media pushing trans stuff and everyone walking on eggshells  people are being cancelled or attacked for believing in biology and having a common sense opinion .in what world does this person live in that they think they are not promoted everywhere and being treated better by feminine products companies than actual women. ridiculousi ve said it once and i ll say it again if you read or watch harry potter or play the game and see goblins as jewish stereotypes and call it out that just shows your antisemitism against the jewish people. she didn t intend them to be jewish stereotypes when she wrote in and i never once thought anything of the sort till this game first got announced and the wokes started making the worst connections between the two. the people screaming racism sexism antisemitism bigots are projecting so much in my experience they are the worst of what they complain about.
some people are really screwed up.do these people actually believe wat they say  or are they just needing to fit in!
this  vtuber s  are why hololive en wasn t able to play the game.still the game is really made for  modern  audiences. the character customization is so saints row it feels off for a serious game for a harry potter game. also 1800  diversity  is non existent in the age where harry live  poc got eradicated when he was admitted into hogwarts.
i hope pipkin pippa plays the wizard game
we have been seeing munchausen s syndrome by proxy  where children s parents are patting themselves on the back for saving their offspring with virtue signalling  after one medical appointment  they are being put on drugs and puberty blockers  and nobody is questioning what is happening  this is medical malpractice.  children are being bullied into unhealthy situations that cannot be reversed.  in addition  people are being deceived about the seriousness of the hormone treatments  puberty blockers  and surgeries  where the language being used is that surgery is like using lego blocks  and the removed boobs of a woman can be put back on  this is utterly not true  surgery is always destructive to the corpus tissue .  it is a tragedy that is unfolding before us  before an abusive fad and sensation that are based upon lying  so that narcissistic people can believe that they are special victims  listen to the arrogance of the activists  they are taking mental illness into a heavenly normalized traits  you are not special  if you are normal  and the term  special  is an euphemism  instead of saying  idiot  for special education   we see the language being mistreated to support fantasies.  transhumanism is a fad  and it is utterly science fiction  the real human body is irreplaceable.  in addition  gender dysphoria is mental illness  and these people are being coddled and not helped  and they are being led over the cliff with the lemmings  this is  yet  another tragedy  because they are not magic people  they are delusional.  nobody is born with the wrong brain  the body you have is the only one you get.
i am glad to see young women pushing back on this  because imo  most of this nonsense has been allowed and pushed by a bunch of women to begin with. mmgb taking some hardline stances here.
i ll be streaming this morning and making a new character.  bought it during the 72 hour access but it was the start of my work week.  and this is near the end of my work week.  and because i want to laugh the new character will be a trans with blue hair and a man s voice and the name will be trans trender.    gotta have fun with this basically now because i want too
i m very surprised by the goblin antisemitism angle  because they have been a thing since the start of harry potter  and nobody made the very crude connection  and if they did  nobody made a proper stink about it until now. they don t seem to be caricatures of jewish people to me  just bureaucrats. even if they were playing on the stereotype  it s just a stereotype. the goblins are some of the most interesting creatures in the hp universe. incredibly skilled with wand-less magic  control the massive and extremely secure bank with vaults housing any number of powerful and dangerous artifacts. they seemed like very evil monsters in the movies  but surprisingly enough  this game goes into how they re living like ordinary people. they re so powerful without wands that the wizards made it illegal for them to wield them. now that sounds badass. if i were jewish and were compared to goblins from hp  i would be happy about that  to be honestly. there are far worse things to be compared to.
trans-trenders  i hope this term sticks
i m getting sick of tired of those people saying that playing hogwarts legacy makes us transphobic. it s not justifiable that those same people saying that is bullying people and streamers cry on camera over the harassment just because of the game having an ip relation to harry potter. this is just out of hand and needs to stop.i m trans myself and i honestly want to get the game to spite these people who keep harassing people for no reason. and if anything  the game itself is actually very friendly towards anyone who s trans or lgbt.anyway  love the videos on your channel melonie  absolutely love your content and hope your channel continues to grow.
as a father i subscribe to this so much. you just got yourself a subscriber.
ahhh you have a cat!!!! i love it!
i ll be honest  hearing all these woke losers say that liking certain video games  anime  and other forms of entertainment  that i ve come to enjoy  makes me the bad guy in this situation only further encourages me more to be the bad guy. at least the bad guys know how to have fun.
his mind is completely broken  can t even think logically. he throws out buzz words into a sentence  praying it comes out making sense.
brilliant speech mac. you unashamedly said what i am sure a lot of us are thinking.
why is he listing arbitrary reasons why to play a game  literally i just wanted to play a game based on interesting world... no nostalgia  no nothing.not even pushing back on boycott. i had it pre-ordered for my gf since december
12 10 does that include there  transitioning  drugs
these people gotta learn to take an l. when was the last time a single player game blew up this big on twitch or youtube  and so many huge streamers are playing it  some that are far beyond the stratosphere of cancellation. has a  boycott  ever failed so epicly  it s not even like they can take a victory lap on the game being bad....the reviews from both  journo s  and players speak for themselves. these weirdo s are just embarassing themselves at this point. the more they go on about it and shift the goalposts the more unhinged the come across. this is not the behavior of mentally well people.
yes! let s put that 1  in their place.
you should do a zoom with blair white.  she has spoken honestly about gender dysphoria and has a unique take as a transgender who also is not woke.  and the waactivists hate her.
and in the same time they have nothing against atomic heart.a game filled with russian propaganda  created by a company associated with russian oligarchs.which in its privacy policy openly admits that all player data will be transferred to the russian government and the fsb.and they can be used in accordance with local law  including for mobilization purposes.the polish gaming magazine cd-action posted on its channel a practically journalistic investigation on the subject.they are now working on a version with subtitles  when they publish it  i will give a link under the next material about hogwarts lewgacy.
man that guy is hella creepy.
this vtuber would make a perfect antithesis for rev says desu. his antisemitism linked to goblin accountants is more sordid than darksydephil jackbooting aliens in dead space. what offends me so much about the vtuber is that he is a dark elf  and that s truly an effrontery to the dark elf community  given his agenda.
some of these vtubers really think that their character design makes them a main character huh  it s a drawing dude
playing the game right now. i identify as  toxic sis male gamer  i love the taste of leftist tears. i do not particularly like harry potter but game is an gem. absolutely loving it.
here s the kicker if they just would have shut up about the game when they found out about it instead of ranting and raving to the whole world about it they wouldn t have gave it so much publicity that it s going to be considered one of the best selling video games of 2023. and that s not me down playing some really good games coming out this year like star wars jedi survivor and many more. i m just saying it wasn t for all that ranting and raving we wouldn t have gotten as much publicity about this game. so in a way it s all things to them that it was successful. so tha k you woke mob for the free publicity.
in my view it seems to be being used for political and in many cases financial gain and that is the worst part for me.
the way he s trying to school people on what  no ethics under capitalism  means as if he doesn t make any purchases that is non-essential to survival.
i still cant even believe  v-tuber  is a thing.  how ridiculous.
it s not about principles  items about power dynamics. just about every social issue that the sjw leftists is a power dynamic issue wherein they want to hold the power   or actually solve any issues.
i would say learning to hunt or fish as you mentioned are not very good traits for being a man or  manly . i would say a willingness to protect your family under any and all costs is what makes you a man. also i would say you should be slightly more open minded. i actually agree with you but i feel like you are not even listening to what the person in the clip was saying as they had some very valid points. you retorted to multiple things they said with the hunting and fishing things i mentioned earlier which does not give off a vibe that you know ehat your talking sbout. it gives off that vibe i m sure your aware of where it feels like the person you are talking to is not actually listening to what you are saying but they are just getting ready in their heads what they just want to say next anyway. good video but my only advice is to be empathetic.
i swear... back in the days when i was playing a game on vr  social vr  this trans bro  got mad because i said this... oh that stage looks really good!. one day i will be part of this stage meaning i will work hard to be known like him. he.... fucking freaked!    over nothing  never spoke to him again. now... i understand why.
i can t wait to see nux taku s take on this stuff.me  i m gonna stream hwl tomorrow with a purple haired witch named  tedd verres  - and anyone who doesn t get the joke will be taunted mercilessly.
you said it. let kids be kids  until they are old enough to make that decision for themselves.it s disgusting to promote this crap towards kids.
you know  after playing lots of games over the years and all this crap that s been going on for decades i m not transphobic or homophobic. i m transausted and gaysausted. i m tired of this. everything has to point us to the sterilization of humanity. all of our entertainment. i m tired  but that s what they are waiting for everytime we get tired we give a little ground.  i think of the following quote  it s from mark twain but it was requoted by captain america  let men label you as they may  if you alone of all the nation decide one way  and that way be the right way by your convictions of the right  you have done your duty by yourself and by your country  hold up your head for you have nothing to be ashamed of.it doesn t matter what the press says. it doesn t matter what the politicians or the mobs say. it doesn t matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. republics are founded on one principle above all else  the requirement that we stand up for what we believe in. no matter the odds or consequences.when the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move. your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth and tell the whole world  no  you move.
this makes me depressed lol society has fallen off so bad although i noticed it s only americans crying about people playing the harry potter game
they bullied pikamee  a sweet kettle  and the silvervale till she cried. all for a little bit of clout  these people have metal illness from being chronically online and need to touch some grass and see real issues are  like being homeless  unemployed  poverty  trafficking  not having enough money to feed your kids  those a real issues
here s an analogy. i am bi polar 2 meaning i suffer from depression the majority of the time and have mania infrequently. now let s take this to the trans logic of dealing with mental health issues and stop the medications that treat the most severe symptoms and let the unmedicated person make a decision on their own. i can tell you the result i would be dead since before treatment i was depressed to the point of suicide. the point being you cannot let mental health sufferers make life altering decisions without first having some kind of treatment for said mental disorder.
so what your saying is. i need to take my playstation out side. play hogwarts while grilling a nice fat steak and then drink a glass of whole milk.
i don t even get the  goblins look like jews  thing. you realize how different jews look  i have a friend who is a black jew. there are jews of every shape  size  and color because it s a religion. that s like saying muslims look like arab people. it s not a thing. anyone can be a muslim  anyone can be a christian  buddhist  hindu  etc. that s how religions work. not that i would expect these people to understand that.
imagine being so triggered by a fictional video game that you go after people just looking for some enjoyment.  smh.  i hope this game breaks records!
sounds like someone is pinching his nose
in all fairness i honestly could care less  when the first harry potter movies released there were christians trying to boycott them and screaming that they were satanic  this situation is no different  people fighting over a fictional game which has no relevance to the real world whatsoever. every time a christian quotes or uses the bible as a example i wonder if they actually heard of dante s inferno  the templar knight that believed he was doing gods work and ended up going through hell anyway.
so why don t they boycott disney  legos  book stores   its all just so they can show who they truly are.i hope this shows companies these people have no real power.
i love that it s a v-tuber... someone too chicken too even show their face to strangers on the internet  that s the type of person who dose this.
i didn t climb to the top of the food chain to eat food s food.
since when is goblins hoarding gold a new thing  these people are reaching into the pits and it s beyond infuriating because every single one of them believes they are the true voice of reason and find nothing wrong with dictating their mindset to any and all. truly some of the worst representations of modern day humanity. the devs put gay and trans characters in the game and allow you to create a trans character because they wanted to create a game for  everyone . it s a clear stance against rowling s remarks. this game was already in production when her remarks came to light so for the dev team to not only not stand with her remarks but deliver a quality product that reflects their views on the matter is commendable as hell.
the irony from this guy to say  suck it up .
it would be interesting to see how many of the people who are vocally condemning this game or have said they won t play it have secretly bought the game and are playing it.also  as an asian  i find it offensive that he is using an anime style character in the way he is. he obviously has no issue offending asians by presenting himself in such a manner. i say he is committing cultural appropriation and should stop immediately. he is presenting as a waifu. shameful.
so - wired released their  review  of hogwarts legacy and gave it a 1 10 score. the author of the review s main body of previous reviews are about sex toys. the review itself has nothing to do with the game  game play  mechanics  story  or any other game criteria. it is an agiprop ridden  hyperbole filled diatribe railing against jkr.
it s gonna get worse . yep. day of th rope is coming way sooner than the woketivists realize.
wired just gave the game a 1 10  the whole  review  is a trans activist rant and has very little to with the game. they are getting demolish on their twitter for this and they deserve it
i do think the banker one that was sleeping at the podium looked like some jewish guy but the others just looked like goblins xd
i have run into a single jewish kid  ok  19 but still pretty immature  who seemed to believe goblins were a jewish stereotype. all other jews i know ignored the idea. to bring up jews as a basis for condemning harry potter or the hogwarts game is absurd and abusing the memory of the holocaust for unrelated political power.
1 44 preach!!!!!!
this world needs more melonies.
peak first world problem right there.
trans activists are men who ve picked up on all the worst characteristics of women to develop a personality.  that is probably the truest observation ever.
i ll buy this game just as a big fu to the woke mob
i ve never seen what vtuber content is actually like before and this is seriously deranged. i m truly disturbed
don t like the whole hogwarts thing  books  movies  games  none of it.  but that s nothing to do with what rowling is doing or saying.  it s because i think the whole thing is childish and stupid.  i don t hate on it though and i don t subvert that content to push unrelated ideology.  some folks just need to make it all about them and seek to force their views on everyone and that s what the rowling haters are.
you should see what happen to activists harassing indonesian vtubers playing this game
why don t we just support super tomboyish girls and feminine boys as unique girls and boys instead of forcing the idea they re actually the opposite sex in every way  it seems like a healthier way to deal with gender dysphoria.
it seems like the left has extrapolated disagreeing with someone with hatred. disagreement does not mean hate. if you disagree with someone  that s just not agreeing on something  it doesn t mean you want them to be hurt. fairly often  many people who are having disagreements with trans people mostly want them to get help and understand what they are doing  it does not mean you want them to suddenly be thanosnapped. here s an example  if you have a disagreement about a rule in a card game  you don t want your opponent to actually die or you suddenly hate them  it s just a damn disagreement  dude. if your child wants to have an extra cookie  and you disagree with that  you don t suddenly want your child to be hurt  because it s a disagreement  not hatred. that s what most of everything the left says is hate actually is  honest disagreements and wanting people to understand where you are coming from.
on my newsfeed today   children s tran g nder clinic under investigation after whistleblower speaks out
the its argument in the video you played was  you re getting harassed for playing the wizard game  suck it up.  and that s allowed but if you say  oh you re being harassed for being trans  suck it up.  you get dragged through the dirt for it. why are they given brownie points for being incels but if your opinion differs they call you an incel  make it make sense.
melodie mac i love you thank you
a solution to the feminine men would be to have a liftocracy. weigh the voting to how much a man can bench  squat and deadlift.
4 44 they already are  but on the otherside  it s called fat-pride and  healty at any size .
you sound like and remind me of brett cooper and that s a good thing
this is why my whole life i have been eating nothing but steak!
there tears taste like kool aid and desperation
i like to call this chronically online behavior. if you went outside  or even just didn t use the internet to get into a  mean girls  group  none of this would matter. if people playing a video game pretending to be a wizard is somehow putting you in  danger  please  turn off the screen. tbh tho  i think it s just a new talking point for them  nothing more.
comparing gender dysphoria to anorexia was probably the best way to look at it.
interesting video melonie.  imho  transsexual behavior is abnormal behavior  and abnormal behavior especially when it interferes with other people s lives and requires unreasonable accommodations is considered to be mental illness.  not throwing stones  many of us have issues  just stating an observation that seems to be taboo to speak anymore.
it s so disgusting that he s mentioning  trans kids  what a weirdo.. by the way you roasted this creep it s very satanic. i cover those topics on my page show some love if u want guys
an abundance of soy  particularly in men  is very harmful. if you pick up almost any processed foods you will see soy in nearly everything. including things that wouldn t seem like they needed any soy.
hi  orthodox jew here. i cringed a little when the vtuber here started talking about asking what jewish people think.i think the game is amazing. it s fun  it s got incredible voice acting  and an interesting story so far. i don t  even for a minute  think that the setting s goblins are a stand-in for jews. even a little. his rant actually does more harm to us than anything else from the series or the setting.
the original term of incel was a woman who chooses career over family
of course it s a bloke with an anime avatar.
keep speaking truth  melonie! you re the best.
i love this g me
remember the good times when the whole internet was united in agreeing velma show was trash  how did we instantly get divided again so quickly. well  it s more like a loud minority are the ones still going. i guess we are still united going by all the records hogwarts is breaking. but dear god that minority is loud as heck.
i pre-ordered 3 copies of hogwarts because i was getting low on liberal tears. vtubers make me want to curbstomp puppies  don t get me wrong  i love puppies. must be all of my toxic masculinity. i don t have  phobias   that implies i m scared of them and i m not. they re just annoying and it s way too contagious to impressionable children.
meloni  dont you tell men to go lift weights. dont you know  real men only lift timber and machine parts!  d
in fairness to soy  don t me wrong  i don t like it and it has been years since i had looked into it   soy isn t a true estrogenic. it s a pseudo-estrogenic and they aren t sure how it impacts people as the biggest study done on it showed that it was having estrogenic effects on half the people that ate a lot of it and the other half  no impact. this was a study done in eastern asia  i forget exactly where  and looked at thousands of people over several regions  so not a small study. that s only in fairness to soy. everything else  i 95  agree with. not going into the 5  here cause that would be several paragraphs to fit. lol
well they are a vtuber  they re already cringe af
if you have a problem with someone who is taking royalties from a product that they created the consumers have nothing to do with that. the game was made for fans of the franchise and that s that. nothing in the harry potter world is racist and jk rowling never even said she hates trans people. pointing out biological science is not the same as denying trans people of their existence. i m sorry that your dna isn t what you wanted it to be but  thems the breaks.
all this talk of  how this will hurt the trans community has anyone actually heard an argument as to how this will hurt the trans community sounds like gaslighting to me
while watching this video their was an ad video for hogwarts legacy
meanwhile the game sits at 94  very positive on steam with over 30 000 reviews.
only pippa is vtube. all non-pippa vtube must immediately report to the purification chamber.
why is it the vast majority of proponents for trans rights for children don t actually have children and or the experience of raising children they seem to know what s best for other people s children whilst having immensely limited experience or exposure to children.counterintuitive to assume what kids need when you ve never been responsible for one
there is literally only one person i know who has clinically proven gender dysphoria... she bought the game in deluxe edition and plays since 7th xd
i agree that its mental illness  and agree that children shouldnt transition  but i do feel adults should be able to transition and it is real  i recommend watching someone like the offensive tranny or blairewhite  you can happily transition and it does help their mental health. just most of the people transitioning arent trans  just a little feminine or masculine out side their respective gender roles
we already celebrate eating disorders with fat positive movement
hi  i m a vtuber... and  like  i m a dude wearing an anime girl skin  so  like  please hate harry potter because simps like anime booba.  that s  literally  what i heard. now  i love many vtubers because some of them are actually fun and have a sense of wit. this one...
it s not loud as heck. nobody at my workplace talks about this. non of my friends talk about this. this is all just youtube and twitter drama. and very specific game news.
@x  i guess it depends on the circle. i have a pretty big gaming information circle. unfortunately a decent chunk of it extends towards twitter. that s where i see it the most  of course. i am glad that the twitter mob has lost most of their power when musk took over. they can t outright cancel people anymore. but i do hear about the boycott constantly. but it is true i rarely see people on the side of it. which gives me hope. just a shame haters are burning bridges and destroying friendships over this. that s the sad part.
what about how coming out as gay is celebrated  how is coming out as trans any different  it should be celebrated that a person has finally accepted who they really are  gender dysphoria is not a bad thing and those that finally realise they are trans are better off knowing that they can finally feel better about the body they were not given when they were born  i myself for the longest time was lost because i didn t know i was gender fluid but when i finally accepted that i was gender fluid my life went from gloomy and dissatisfying to much more happier because i finally accepted who i was deep down  i am also bisexual which was another thing i struggles with for the longest time and since admitting that fact i have been much more happier than b4hand.
the way this will stop is. the person can sue to the person who did it till age 30.if it really is good they would allow this right  why are these same people not like this with disney who allows there movies in countries that would throw these same people off buildings or jail them  jk not doing that also i m guessing this is from twitch  guess they don t care about all the stuff amazon been done for real human rights also let s them come to streams it s giving the game  1 best single player game on twitch they re helping
i disagree with the statement that in order to be manly you have to eat meat. if it were true  since you are on a meat diet  you should have become more manly and less feminine. also i have not eaten meat in more than a decade  and i have not noticed any change. but even if not eating meat would damage me  i still would not eat meat  because i like to live life as moral as i can. and eating dead animals doesn t seem moral to me  seems messed up. also to me  manliness means stoicism. for example  when a tall strong man fights a short weak out of shape man  the physically weaker one has to be more brave  since any coward can fight a fight he knows he is going to win.
these goofs somehow think passively means actively.
the only argument i would strongly disagree with is the soy one. the strongest men on earth are vegan. there are vegan athetles  body builders  competitive lifters etc. most of them outperform meat eaters. it is been proven that a plant based diet is the best way to go. most vegans don t even consume that much soy anyways.
this young woman is giving me hope for this young world. not afraid to speak of the lord. young lady witnessed to her viewers without fear. if you already don t know. the holy spirit will fight the fight with you. stay ture. call evil for what it is. and you are right. it is and always has been about god bible
there are online communities for anorexic bulimic girls to encourage their disorders.
i don t always agree with you  and that s all good  but i always respect your backbone and integrity
you pay a price for messing with your  body and yeah i agree be happy with u
here s the thing though it is healthier for a trans person to accept who they are than to try and reverse it  look at the stories of people hating themselves because they have gender dysphoria and think that have some kind of illness that should be cured or would rather die than be gender dysphoric  that kind of mindset is not right  we should celebrate the fact that they are who they are and that it is ok to be that way as it has nothing to do with their health.anorexia is different because that effects their health and their well being to survive because they are not eating enough food to survive  being trans is not going to kill u  being anorexic is going to kill u  being told u have are ill because u are gender dysphoric can make u want to kill yourself being celebrated does the opposite though it makes u happier to be alive so please stop telling people that gender dysphoria is a mental illness that needs to be cured  stop being transphobic.
in this upside down world where talking about chromosome correction in the womb to eliminate downs syndrome is a heresy  but at the same time promoting the abortion of said fetus if the problem is identified early enough. oh sorry  i said problem. i meant normal condition. that is the issue. we keep normalizing abnormalities so people do not have to feel lesser. are you bigoted against blind people if you want to cure blindness  the new tv show  accused  in their second episode did just that for a baby born deaf. parents wanted to try a surgery to help their baby hear. a deaf person reacted as if they were changing the babies identity and thought is was abuse  so stole the baby. it was a horrible episode that made little sense in the end.
liberal friend was the one who told me about the goblen thing we both thought it was funny and moved on
taken by itself  the bible is an awful moral guide. the reason our moral decay has coincided with the decline in religiosity is because of a lack of cultural identity  a common cause of sorts.
bro hope my quote tweet made it into this video
unfortunately the v-tuber group tends to be over-run by the  blue haired weirdo  crowd.  their reaction to this game is only showing their own intolerance.
the funny thing about  woke  culture  is the fact that they are completely asleep to their own mental delusions. hopefully they can change  find faith and recover into normality  but until they do  its free entertainment for us
just wait till the birthing rates keep crashing and everyone is old and alone because no one had kids anymore
good take on that trans shouldn t be bulling streamers  bad take on diet. farming created civilization  check out how the micro-organisms act with plant-based vs animal. also chill a little on bible talk with tats. being woke is just neophytes way of trying to fit in with intellectuals. very punctual though.
downloading the game now.
while you got a lot of things right  i agree with sentiment that underage shouldn t be allowed to get hormone blockers or procedures done  because we don t know the affects long term yet. however  trans kids do exist - i don t know what kind of statement that is to make that they don t  you state yourself trans is a disorder  children can have disorders. i don t know if you genuinely didn t know this  but a lot of teens have ed s too  so where exactly were you going with stating that trans kids don t exist    there wouldn t be a demand for these procedures if they didn t willingly exist. you re the one that sounds like lunacy with this claim. also comparing a mental disorder like an ed to being trans is not nearly the same thing. people with ed s have to go to rehab and are sometimes hospitalized because they are in such bad condition  this is threatening their life. there is no indication that being trans will put you in a hospital bed hooked up to iv s because you are so malnutritioned.. this is just a horrible take   comparison.
no ethical consumption under capitalism  said by a an upper middle class yuppie who has the luxury of pontificating on whether or not the unethical parts of capitalism taint the good parts.
that s probably the gluten. gluten can make you irritable and catty.
you obviously have been ignoring all the horror stories of people transitioning and later regretting it. there are more than you think
bringing up diet..  blasted soy is getting in everything.   i don t eat cereal. ..once in awhile oatmeal.   regards to red meat i actually feel better eating it vs. poultry or fish.   although i consider beef  pork  poultry and fish as the real 4 food groups.
need to superglue the sunglasses on to their face from  they live.
the game is woke as fuck  for anyone who thinks that this somehow defeats the woke mob -- it doesn t....
easy to talk trash about people who just want to enjoy a harmless game in peace  if you hide behind a vtube avatar with jiggle physics...they re like the people that thought mortal kombat and doom were going to encourage teens to become serial killers  or mistakenly thought  night trap  was a perverse snuff film game.  it wasn t. or how peta thought mario was evil for wearing a tanooki suit that isn t even made of real fur...and the irony is  the game actually has lgbtq representation in it  something many on both sides forget about.
listen to its voice.. this person is crazy
seeing that buying hogwarts legacy  directly funds rowling s political activity to take rights away from trans people whom she doesn t think should exist  people thinking a tuber crying about being attacked for promoting said game are pathetic.
the only legitimate reason for hormone blockers is if a pituitary gland is malfunctioning
since i ve stumbled upon your channel i ve really been enjoying your content. but i must say as a fellow christian i don t think you should be supporting this game because it glorifies and uplifts witchcraft especially since you claim to be christian as well. just my opinion. no hate from me  but i think you should pray about it. god bless.
of course  society has gone insane. that s what happens when you let the lunatics run the asylum.
he doesn t even sound like he knows what hes talking about  other then a woke journalist  said  these things  and they don t even know what they are talking about etherthis akso makes me embraced to be a vtuber
12 10 he not a gamer wtf.
this is what happens when you feed too many men soy!! lmao that was funny.
these people mad about harry potter really need help  something wrong mentally
wish i had more money to eat steak..
it s impossible to transition to the opposite sex. this is just a simple basic fact. so be happy with what you are.
when it was just twotter drama the public didnt care but this is now being pushed in law and into the lives of our girlfreinds wives daughters sister s these idiots are bringing about the nasty response they cry about
of course it is a male voice ... to me i don t hear a  male  voice
here is how i see it  if you are an adult  idc  not even a little bit  how you wanna live your own live. cut things away  do whatever treatment you wanna do  grow out your hair whatever  i don t give a sh t!but don t you ever  ever expect me to see you for something else when you are clearly not what you attempt me to believe! i respect your decision  i address you the way you want it  but i cannot see someone as a different gender other than the birth gender he or she was born with  my instincts tell me otherwise. and no surgery and treatment in the world can fix that  we do not have the technology!
they see me rowling  they hatin
them  pink is just a color  stop saying it s for girls.also them  my son picked out a pink shirt  guess he identifies as a girl..
the creators were trying to placate and appease that crowd when they should ve just ignored them. the internet and the overt liberal-ness of social media does not reflect politics  politicians  nor the general public of any country anywhere
it s fictional witchcraft  not real. when it comes to minor things like this you should follow your own convictions and not tell others what to do  there are bigger fish to fry than getting onto a brother or sister over a video game
this is why i myself do not like religious people sometimes.   there was no reason for your comment.  if you believe the way you do then don t go tell others they should think the same. respect is a two way streetmy comment is for the op.  not meloniebut yes as she said. believe what you want to believe.  don t expect others to believe just because you believe
@mohawk_productions  there was a reason for my comment. and because you can t seem to discern it s purpose than it wasn t for you. stay out of peoples conversations that weren t meant for you and you ll be alright.
@john tiggs long  no
well to be fair lol pink can look good on a guy just gotta know what material to wear.
@unfiltered and neva censored gaming  hey  i got a pink shirt and love it. no shade to anyone who likes colors of any kind. just thought it was funny how blatantly hypocritical the woke tend to be. they need to stop caring what strangers think of them and just be themselves. if they need the approval of strangers to be happy  they ll never be happy.
@lucifer s onion  nah fam you spoke true facts. and you good. lol i m making light on the topic.
they failed. things are looking up.
idgf about the hate still gonna play this beautiful game
people need to go outside and touch grass.
game is hot. i m playing it right now.
anna rex  new channel for tswg  king of annas
keep crying harder please. literally writing this while hl is running.
lmao this is what happens when you don t eat meat as a man lol that crack me up
wired gives 1 10 lul.  gamergate
i love the fact that 99.9  of the world doesn t care.
and some of us didn t care either way but they re making it didn t do an issue and making an a   of themselves
brilliant
the reason why weak men are the most toxic is  small dog syndrome  small dogs have to yap harder because they can t afford to get into a fight.
as a jew i love jk
give mm your tears nerds so she doesn t get dehydrated again
even jk rowling admits it is a thing to be trans
bout to play this game

einstein said ww3 will be dealt with nukes and ww4 will be with sticks and stones
ill proabbaly buy hwl just to piss these guys off honestly
when you going to be in muscle and fitness lol
and all these people post on twitter knowing that elon musk said the same thing that j.k. rowling did... the irony.
by the way  i m adding  trans-trenders  to my vocabulary.
transtrender needs to be a coined term like yesterday.
honestly tiktok to i mean i bought a hogwarts legacy shirt
8 30 cat.
i d personally have islamic books in the background and pplay it and often quote then positive things that are said about jews and propher moses and see if they d dare target me  well even if that happens im a tiny krill fish in the ocean lol  just 16 subs and 1 live viewer so i doubt i d make a dent on this anime avatar tuber
wow this person is literally mansplaining why they thinkyou should do what they want you to
10 16strawman arguments  but not before the delusional narratives.. as usual. some of these vtubers really descend into the madness of their false reality
how d those jiggly physics go again  melonie
of course. someone hiding behind a cartoon avatar  and altering  i think   their voice is doing this kind of stuff.
very based
the two genders. hogwarts and legacy.
lol. the music is ironically appropriate.
i immediately stopped caring about what this guy had to say once i heard he disabled comments. if you can t take it  don t dish it.
honestly i m all for these losers to keep trying to cancel the game. all they re doing is exposing themselves to the normies and seeing the kind of lunacy and the war being waged.
hogwarts legacy hater  dont stream this gamestreamer  if you don t like it why are you here hater  do bring awareness that trans lives matterstreamer  so hating your self and cutting body parts off makes you a hero champion hater    .
e-girl
was that a girl pretending to be a man or a man pretending to be a cartoon
satanic ! wtf
there was a short the other day. not sure who they were but they she he them whatever it waswas wearing a  trans kids matter  shirt
the voice that thing does makes my skin crawl.
i don t have the equipment to recreate that
@melonie mac go boom  disagree  p
you don t want to drink trans tears  melonie. might have toxic levels of hrt hormones.
twitter sphere  twitter echochamber
v tubers in general are cringe
this same crap happened in the early 2000s. the skater bois  blink 182  afi kids  the emos  thought being gay was so cool... it s a trend  except this trend is one that can t be taken back afterwards. and whoever is making children question their sex should be arrested. little kids don t even need to know about sex.
dafuq is a v tuber  we going to have 24 other letters types of  tuber  now yes i know youtuber isn t utuber  but i m counting it.
why does every autogynephiliac sound like a chain smoker
wolves hunt  sheep get slaughtered....fact!
that s any heavy alcohol consumption. theses types would not consume enough alcohol to lower testosterone. drinking beer alone  first time in my life i ever heard that.
you have a great hair!
being vegetarian isn t the issue  it s being uneducated on basic ethics
world premier trailer for the marvels super bowl sunday yall.
bullies deserve to have their bullying ratioed.
nothing wrong with cereal and or beer.
uhm... people getting harrassed for playing a videogame is  shut up and suck it up  ..uhm okay i learned something. next time someone is  harrassed for being trans  we all go...oh shut up...suck it up... funny how such things only work in one direction with activists
my last post was censored so i ll just say about the man
crazy shit... this trans movement really seems to be an attack on women honestly    these dudes are beyond fucked
regarding the children my god i was a kid once no damn way they understand anything before puberty and fun fact puberty is different for some it take longer or its sooner 18 and up is the choice age not before let them grow leave them be unless its somthing the kid is interested in or wants to study on let it be and even than thats somthing they can prep for when there older sure educate them but dont operate on a child or try to get them involved in adult content please its discusting and robs them.
all this does and make me hate the alphabet mafia more and more
yeah. we actual men disown those feminine  men . having lost theythemtheir man card an age ago    generally refered to now as 8itchy or just 8itch .
lol. sometimes many ugly people do looks like goblins. so what!
thank you so much!
if you want to lower you testosterone then go for it lol
huuuuuufffing that copium
yo i dont know where you live so you might not have heard of this  but i love whataburger lmao  cheeseburgers are great  but chicken i still my favorite meat  still sucks red meat is less healthy and hard on the gut    anyways the video was fun you got a sub  3
these are the same people who say  insert demographic here  is not a monolith  and then they go speak for every one in it and say they are doing a good thing. it s demeaning. stop.
actually shut up and suck it up is great advice. they should listen to their own advice.
okay rowling 2.0  no idea how you win against a society of suckling consumers anyway
still waiting on my transphobe badge i was told i would be branded with for playing this game. getting real impatient.
they are the most toxic because twnbaw
ratio d. . when idiots outweigh sanity  and therefor idiocy wins
yea less give someone weirdo vtuber a voice  .
trans trender
muggles stay hating
i didn t even know people were saying that about jewish people until i watched this video   i heard about the trans stuff but i never heard about that  i never even thought it either and i still don t think it having played the game!  so that s crazy
it s a mangina.
trans kids do exist though  there are kids out there that believe themselves to of been born as the wrong gender just because they are kids doesn t mean they can t have these feelings melonie  yes they absolutely should be allowed to just be kids but saying that trans kids dont exist is inherently wrong since there are children out there that feel like they dont belong because they weren t the gender they were born as in their minds and saying they dont exist hurts them more than helps them.i myself was unbeknownst to myself actually trans as a kid i just at that point didn t understand it because i would always want to dress in girls clothing but i couldn t let anyone know about it since that wasn t considered a normal thing to do  so i stole a girls clothing that stayed at my house from time to time and wore them in secret under my male clothing so no one would know  now i know that that was because i am trans but at the time i didn t and i wish i had someone telling me back then that it was ok for me to feel that way and that i shouldn t of been ashamed to want to wear women s clothing because there is nothing wrong with that.now allowing a child who believes themself to be trans to block their hormones or switch genders that is a whole nother thing entirely and yea that is wrong  they should be allowed to express how they feel and be allowed to be the gender they want but anything that alters the body in any way shouldn t be allowed until they turn a18 and become a legal adult.
it is so funny. they go after a game. universal studios made her really rich   we have children workers in mines so we can have our batteries in our phones and cars.  but no  a video game  really  this world is a scary place to be in right now. i am so glad i don t have any children to see this shit.
go boom
gee  a female anime avatar with a male voice. who saw that coming    sarcasm
these people need to read mythology and see the images of goblins....they have big noses and what not.
anna rex   stupid youtube.
beer does not make you like this...  maybe lite beer  but that is like sex in a canoe
when you feed men too much soy
one thing this wokies have to learn. nature will always win
i m getting it come payday
they say the jews should be offended as if mel brooks never played a jewish parody of yoda back in the 80s  when things were still cool
could you not   i could  but i wont.
first of all this is the most cringe person i ve ever seen.second of all   eat a steak and learn hunting  is the most melonie thing i ve ever heard and laughed way too hard.
honestly you saying it s a metal health thing is true transphobia jk rowling is just worried of people abusing the term
the tears schtick was cringy when liberals first used it  it s still cringy now
they should be protesting uyghur treatment in china or the stopping of pipelines in na  border issues one way or another is better than wasting time over when jk said only two sexes.
i m jewish i watched the game all the way through and its literally trans people saying goblins look like us. goblins have literally existed in mythology and in  gaming forever. its really telling of how they view others compared to themselves. evil people.
he s an insult to elves.
why would i listen to any of those people  their opinions are irrelevant to me
i say that all the time   no such thing as trans kids  these are child abusers
like destiny.

stop being a freaky alien genotype!
eating disorders are being celebrated though.
beer raises estrogen in men  marketing toward men is a psyop. they want y all weak.
@melonie mac go boom  as a homebrewer  i have to ask where the estrogen comes from.  should i start buying raw barley and roasting it myself   my uncle actually grew the hops i used in one batch years ago.  could it be the yeast   not sure where you got this idea  other than the general detrimental effects of alcohol
now they started talking about some propaganda regarding the goblin horn  a jewish horn  the wrong year of the riots vs. the rebellion. they forgot the wizards are being oppressed in that year too  because of the witch trials.
troony troons
people who promote or engage in child mutilation should be in prison.
some weirdo gay trans whatever dude pretending to an animated demon chick on the internet does not get to tell me what to do or how to feel about it. the cringe levels on this have reached maximum levels.
sounds like a non bisexual irregular lgbtq ultra straight but a the same time woman person on the video
so by this v-tubers logic  anyone that disagrees with what they re doing should go into their chat and harass the shit out of them  and when they  literally  cry  just tell them to suck it up  and they will  lol. i mean practice what you preach  right  the lack of self awareness and delusional hypocrisy is laughably absurd..
i would look at this situation differently if it was anti potter targeting everything potter related. i would not give a fuk but at least i would understand because its consistent. but the way it is  all i see is targeted harassment  attempt to cancel people on top of actively trying to destroy the studio. because lets not pretend. we all know if a game crashes and burns and costed enough the studio might get disbanded and people will lose jobs. it happen multiple times already. so i have 0 sympathy for whoever participates in this bs and assume they are  let s say  mentally unwell. because i try to be nicer on the internet.
i say live and let live. if people want to be trans  that s fine. but when i hear the term  trans kids   i shudder. here are my 3 rules 1  don t tell me what to do2  don t break the law3  leave kids aloney all are breaking rule number 3.  trans kids  are two words that should never go together.
a man pretending to be an anime girl pretending to be a jew... what else
these wactavists are encouraging the transphobia. i m getting scared of them and the power they seem to wield
i found myself to not caring about this whole topic to hearing ppl getting harrassed. to hearing dumb take after dumb take  to starting to dislike trans ppl now.imagine what this is doing to ppl who already had problems with them in the past...
i bet this trans vampire is way hotter than that avitar.
i m currently waiting for the game to install on my ps5. then i m gonna play the game to my  bigoted  little hearts content. clowns.
the worst thing i have ever saw is this video  raised without gender   it s sick to raise children this way and i don t understand why these 2 adults aren t charged with child endangerment.
100  that vtuber is a middle aged  lonely  white guy.
you don t affirm trans people for the same reason we don t give anorexics diet pills.
i was never transphobic. but now i m trannyphobic as hell.
pcdenuvobad
minors should not undergo hormone therapy or transition surgery. they are too young to know the permanent ramifications of transitioning. also hormone therapy during puberty can cause a fuck ton of rather severe sometimes permanent problems. if they are 18  and an adult they can transition with out any complaint from me but only when they re an adult.
what a hypocrite.
give it 3 year s for the government to make underages do the birds and the bee s legal and that when people like me and others will go bloody mental and protest and go against it because kid s are kid s and i find school s are useless.
u can t change sex copeeeeeee ur still male
who is this vtuber
i cannot believe you cant even say certain words on youtube anymore. its gotten so far out of hand i cant stand it.
bruh imagine caring about what lefties think of you.
male voice
i was promised a genocide simulator. false advertising  0 10.
not to be vulgar but read about the final operation and the out come. it will make you vomit.
vtubers in general are cringe it has that lgbt tr4anny vibe
they wanna cancel people for playing hogwarts as they use twitter owned by a billionaire man who mocks trans people and pronouns  oh the irony. i bought the deluxe edition baby.
racists that s who thinks that.  these people don t see the irony.
you seem extremely out of touch
they call it  that wizard game  why can t it be that witch game   wokies are sexist
lost me at the bible stuff  but everythjng else 100 !
preach!!!!!
sadly people already support eating disorders  you would just be called fatphobic.
damn  play the video and then talk about it . please  dont go on 23904832084490832490 tangents for x s sake....
hey melonie.. there is a channel on youtube you might like.. it s viva la dirt league.. that makes fun of trble a games
hey mel can i name my character as a member of the biggit family
love you
i eat meat.
hold up. ignoring transgender people when they complain is violence  but everyone else needs to suck it up and stop complaining
haha yes! do it!
@melonie mac go boom  roger thanks for responding... now which name shall i pick... sasha biggit   berry biggit  izza biggit  fuzzy biggit  magga biggit   ...
about goblins looking like jews  is ganondorf is a jew  is the legend of zelda antisemitic
imagine being so butthurt you need to harass people for playing something on the basis that a woman said that bio women and trans women are different.... then calling them butthurtlmao
en vtuber moment
trans women are men cosplaying as women. if they re really a woman  then that dude in the red and blue tights running around comic con is really spiderman
lmao  soy induced delusion. but yeah agreed on the immasculation of men.
trans kids  are people crazy kid is just a kid for sure but hey if a kid wants to wear boys close or girls clothes its whatever but some how they took it as oh my kid wants to be come a boy or become a girl that is where we are now and it is crazy
its amazing that all these people are also commies. its like theres a connection.
you are so cute
i m not even laughing anymore  these people actually need mental help.
why people trying to throw the jews into this   i haven t heard one of them complain about this game. the fact that these people somehow drew a line from goblins to jews kind of makes them out to be antisemitic.
i m part of the lgbt community and i disagreed with like 50  of what you said in this video  and yet i d rather watch 500 hours of your content instead of seeing just one more slacktivist hogwarts legacy tweet lol. it s incredible to me how many people are absolutely foaming at the mouth over a video game. there are so many important things in this world to protest about  and somehow a video game is the most important thing  obviously it s because it s easier to sit inside and harass people on twitter than actually doing something  volunteering  donating to charities  etc   but it s just so ridiculous to me how self-righteous the terminally online twitter folks are about this. i respect people s personal decisions to boycott the game  but frankly it s idiotic to try to police other people over a game. jk rowling is rich  the game was going to sell a ton either way  and i don t understand why anybody thought that a boycott would actually work  vs people just choosing not to buy it personally  which makes sense . at least it s funny how multiple people have called me a transphobe for playing the game when i m literally nonbinary. i guess i hate myself now or something   and want to genocide myself  since apparently that s what buying this game will do .unrelated to the actual topic though  the nutrition thing is so true. can t speak for other countries  but the general understanding of nutrition in america is deplorable and i wish there was more effort put into actually teaching kids about it in school. i have health problems that led to me having to see a nutritionist  and study up a bunch personally   and it opened my eyes to the sheer amount of misinformation being flung around in this country. and the prevalence of processed nutritionally deficient foods in the average american s diet certainly doesn t help.edit  also maybe the reason why i can respect your opinions while personally disagreeing with them is because you re expressing them on your personal platform instead of bullying harassing random twitch streamers about them lmao... wish the twitter mob would take notes on that one.edit2  also  the game is incredibly fun  for anybody on the fence about buying it. easily one of my favorite aaa games in the past few years. as a long time hp fan  it really does feel like a childhood dream come true  and the art direction gameplay music are phenomenal
what s a v tuber
transpeople think that everybody else is transphobic but we re not we don t fear you. learn what the word phobia means before you go using it
i guess vtubers are immune to the whole  black face  thing...
completely agree with you. but the  satanic  point kinda lost you a lot of credibility in my eyes. what s religion got to do with anything
is that seriously a dude being an anime female dwarf online  talking about sanity cool. call yourself a dinosaur  for all i care. just don t call me anti-prehistoric if i want to play a good video game based upon popular books and best-selling movies.
trying to hide his mpox
dear lord the soy is strong with this one! my daughter is less of a whiner.
they all sound the same too. like everytime   man and chick they all have the same voice
men wanting to be women is a sign in islam that the end of the world is coming lol
this monstrosity lol
@melonie mac go boom  hey vtubers are persons with avatar  theyre different  theres nice based vtubers like pipkin pippa and kirsche
@melonie mac go boom  lol guess i m getting old fr. never heard of that b4. learn something new every day.
the comparison to eating disorders is very apt. they are a type of body dysmorphia just like gender dysphoria is. they are caused by the same root problem  a distorted sense of self. i literally do not understand how they cannot see that. i could sit around and poke logical holes in almost every single position they hold  it infuriates me.
i m a young gay man and this is ridiculous trying to boycott a game   hogwarts legacy is fantastic it s nothing to do with trans people !! lol
surgical and hormonal treatments do not transform a man into a woman.  trans are not going to experience the following channel  rena malik  m.d.title  wondering what happens to a female body during orgasm  a urologist explains date  jan 30  2023channel  dandelion medical animationtitle  do you know how orgasm is in females  female body and biology   biology of female orgasmdate  sept 21  2022
if goblins are jewish  then every game ever with goblin enemies should be banned. and every movie ever made where goblins are evil  banned.
vtubers like that are embarrassing. i love my meats!
imagine being a v tuber and thinking anyone outside of their weirdo simp fans cause what they say or think
ultra based
i can t remember the last time when i heard someone say that transkidds don t exist.. it s crazy how we ended here.. wish you the best
melonie  i ain t gonna lie.....this video was based as fuck.
gender dysphoria is not a bad think thank your very much  there is nothing wrong with having gender dysphoria  it shouldn t be praised but it is not a bad thing like u say it is so just stop saying that right now.feeling like you were born with the wrong set of genitals is not a mental illness in the slightest  it is in no way a bad thing  if someone doesn t feel comfortable with the gender they were born as that is absolutely fine  being unhappy with ones self is not a bad thing or an illness it is simply human nature and by u saying that it is a bad thing that is transphobic no matter what u say  i can get behind women wanting the proper rights because they were born that gender but in no way should trans people be denied the fact that they are who they are and that it is not an illness that u can simply get rid of.
these people are the same people who grew up without a father  fatherless activities
it s like dealing with a bunch of whining 3 year olds... also the v tuber embarrassed themselves already by being a v tuber....
first i am jewish by blood.i am not offended  i do not practice judaism.however that is irrelevant  i know she doesn t actually care about the opinions of jews.have her go ask ben shapiro a practicing orthodox jew his opinion.she will immediately dismiss him and the reason why is because the truth doesn t matter she only cares about the opinions of those that agree with her.jew  trans  whatever as long as you agree we are cool.
very telling that this guy couldn t even stay on topic but had to start spouting about veganism and anti-capitalism.
not... a ... man!
the jew   goblin comparison has the same energy as black people   orc. if you look at a fantastical creature and make a racial connection where there is none then i m sorry to say but your the racist here not the fictional character.
they lack critical thinking. i think they threw that out along with teaching cursive writing.
fatherless individuals
mel.. the world is going to get worse  before it gets better.
it s like these activists don t know how to have fun.
this ppl is sick.
they should not be encouraging kids to be trans. i think this is a crime. kids just don t know any better.
sorry  i cannot take any vtuber seriously. just can t do it.
vtubers thinking weebs are woke really do not know their audience...
brainwashed by soy! it began with milk  but later came the beans!
holy fishpaste!! it s a guy!!
wait.....the goblins are jewish  how !
someone actually linked me this twitter video to try and support their point. i just can t believe such people exist that choose to be ignorant and think they are legit in the right. but most of these kinds of people are just narcist. i m only finding that out recent but it s been so much easier to block and mute these people and move on. because it s a waste of energy to provide logic and facts to these people because they will never think they are wrong even if you sit evidence down in front of their nose.
whatever a woman tells you to eat more red meat and lift weights don t say anything but yes ma am .
holy shit they said goblins look like jews  that s fucked up bro
people are offended by everything.
i agreed with you until you started spouting the satanic nonsense. c mon now. beating crazy with more crazy rarely works.
weeb -  you got harassed for playing a game  suck it up lol also the weeb - disabled comments because of getting heat.
that s a guy    definitely a transmission or a fig-newton...
i think this guy s diet is the least of his problems honestly.
so based
i hate this timeline
damn  that vtuber was cringy-er than the quartering   pals and  tim drama. yikes.
why can t people just learn to be happy or at least be okay with the way god made them ...
gatekeep fantasy. gatekeep games. gatekeep vtubing. kick. these. freaks. out.
you re laughing. this game is supposedly supporting trans and goblin genocide and you re laughing
eat red meat  eggs and dairy and thrive!
diet affects your physical and mental health dramatically  so yeah  diet would fix a ton of it.
@melonie mac go boom  i don t disagree melonie but i think just from the way he talks and seeing his avatar that he s probably some kind of sociopath. even good nutrition can t fix that unfortunately haha
goblin genocide  hahahahahahaha
it sounds like you are saying trans people have a mental health problem. there s absolutely nothing wrong with someone coming out as trans or gay you talk about living in a perfect world but in a perfect world why can t they be loved for who they want to be on the inside  sorry but you have to take an l on this one.
only the best vtubers will be able to surviveall the lower tier ones will be replaced by robots soonneuro sama is coming for your jobs and trash tier vtubers will be gone soon!and good riddence
cmon lady  everyone agrees that kids cannot consent to sex  but they can consent to removing their sex.
the jiggling is disgusting ffs...
v tubers are cringe incarnate. this is psychopathic and sociopathic behavior. especially when you are a man using a sexualized vampire anime woman as your avatar. the audacity of him to take god s name in vain while asking people to be  do the right thing  ...
its so funny that this so called vtuber is using captilism and proft from it  so they think to be a streamer is not a result of capitalism  ok...
there is a trans woman in the game and yet people are hating on it  so wouldn t that make them transphobic by their own logic  it s insane how people are seething over a fucking game.
your videos would be much better if you d play thd whole thing before your rant. frankly  the abrupt stop start made me leave half way through. play the video  then comment. we don t need a play bt play.
2 genders
you i don t listen to trans .. not even a little
the ending part was not really needed. don t need to bring religion in to this. everything else  was okay.
cry about it.
@kiwidood  cry about what
@copium  sounds like your everyday life.
@samuel chulsky  1. she may have said that but i did not do you need to retake your reading comprehension classes 2. tell that to the dsm 5
@elapid python  i never said that you did. do you need to retake your remedial classes
@samuel chulsky    1. to say trans kids doesn t exist is the most ignorant thing a person can say.  2. being trans is not and never will be a mental health problem.  do you think i dont see comments in my notifications even if you delete them
@elapid python  what!
@samuel chulsky  the comment i have in quotes only shows up in my notifications so i asumed you deleted it if you did not sorryhowever to clarify what i was getting at prior to the tangent you literally put words in my mouth by saying  to say trans kids dont exist is the most ignorant thing a person can say  despite the fact that until you made that comment nobody brought up trans kids hens the reading comprehension remark
@elapid python  omg! she said all this not you. what are you even talking about!  i m referring to her.
@samuel chulsky  sure you were refering to her but i was not and you were responding to me not her and i did not bring trans kids into this at all do i need to walk you through this step by stepyou start this off by talking about how being trans is not a mental illness i rebut this by pointing out the biological reality that you cant change your genderlet me remind you that now you are arguing with me not the videoyou then make the out-of-left-field claim that trans kids are real which the video may have said they weren t but i did notremember your arguing with me at this point not the video which means that the video may have made points i would not make and may not agree with here i also point you to the dsm for your claim that trans is not a mental illness but you dodged that one entirely then we got off on the tangent about the comment being deleted which is not relevent to the argument at all which i will take the blame for that was my badafter the tangent i very clearly explain to you how you put words in my mouth by bringing up the trans kids finally we are at now now where you claim to be refering to the video despite the fact that we are arguing here between the two of us the video left relevenace a long time ago thus bringing it up randomly servers no purpose other than to put words in my mouth about a point i dont agree with
with reactionary content that will usually get you flagged
