targeting the kids and pushing sexuality of any kind on them  is something christians and atheists alike can unite on.
remember who goes full tilt for  pride  month  and add them to the growing list of companies. it s tie we finally crush esg!
let s turn pride month into boycott month. boycottmonth
i feel like june 2021   2022 really started to annoy people. when dylan mulvaney s face popped up in april for bud light  people blew a gasket  it was like the straw that broke the camels back  people are over pride month. it s just gotten to ridiculous and it s energy draining. it s like the relative that over stays their welcome. it s just too much. people are just over it. it would be no different if i celebrated 4th of july for an entire year non-stop  eventually people are going to get tired of the fire works. you can t celebrate something this much for this long  it s unsustainable.
make june  boycottmonth. shun the woke corpos  buy local at mom and pop shops  the farmer s market  anything but a corporation. enrich your community  not the corpos.
i m so happy to see people finally boycotting these companies with their wallets.  pride goeth before destruction  and an haughty spirit before a fall.  - proverbs 16 18.
wouldn t it be cool for the month of june that we all go in a no buy  only shop at a farmers market instead of a grocery store  go on a picnic instead of a restaurant  no shopping  no to sales  just a simple no buy month to tell corporations that at the end of the day  its the costumer s money that matter instead of esg dei investment firms money.
never go back.  let these companies die.
them admitting satan is their ally is finally letting the cat out of the bag. glad more people are speaking out against this.
nonconformity to the world s view.it s what christ wants.
i thought it was supposed to be  pride goes before a fall . all these companies must have found a way speed run going bankrupt and it s become a competition
my wife was the first the break this situation to me  and she decided immediately - permanent boycott. i agree with her 100 . the tolerance slippery slope just became a brick wall.
i would feel sorry for them  but i don t.
stand up for what s right melonie. don t stop  even if you do lose friends. jesus loves you mel. i ll be praying for you.
i love when companies hate money.
i love when people try to call you a fake christian but then they re the people who try to  modernize  christianity. the bible ain t a marvel movie  you re not going to change anything in it and god isn t going to support it. i m sorry to hear you ve lost friends over your faith  i ve been blessed with great friends who accept my faith. remember you ve found a new crowd here who thinks like you and we re not going anywhere. you do amazing work with this topic melonie  you have a bigger voice here than you may think. have a fantastic day  and love the room!
this is gonna be a month of good content can t wait for the troll month it s gonna be crazy
target has another problem.  a recent abc six month investigation found that target  and walmart  were not recycling the plastic bags they were collecting as they said they were.  the vast majority of the bags target collected were sent to landfills both inside and outside the u.s.
i did not think people would get this fed up and truly start boycotting. maybe there s hope for the world yet.
so glad to see your perspective on this  melonie. i absolutely believe you shine the brightest when discussing topics like this. god bless you
anyone with a sense of human decency.
muslims join here.
i think it s something anyone who isn t completely evil and or delusional can unite on.
buddhists are on board too
agnostics are here also!
pedophile behavior is not acceptable to me.  their activities between consenting adults is their business.   they ask me about my faith i ll discuss it otherwise i won t condon what they do just leave it in the bedroom.
pretty on target if you ask me. badum tsss....i ll see myself out.
i love that at the end of the day  we can respect anyone  except wokes
and us gays with common sense are here to join
that s why they re called target  because they target children.
we need to bring back the cruasders asap.
@rei caixa  and pedophiles. but that goes without saying
the enemy of my enemy is now my friend
all rainbow companies and even people with it in their bios should be destroyed to the core.
@der magnus  most likely it will happen for history has repeated itself many time s.
what s esg
@melchior  maybe  this i think environmental  social and governance.
@melchior  environment social governance. it s how companies arre being scored which requires they follow these crazy policies or be penalized.
@melchior  extreme sexual gratification
i m prepared to not spend a penny in june except for groceries from the local farms and gas  and if i gotta boycott gas companies i ll keep my butt at home for a month
@melonie mac go boom  aren t you meant to be a gamer how about you play some games instead of whining about politics
@dragon ball fans can t read i never saw her gaming  i thought it was a commentary channel. but she talks gaming.
@dragon ball fans can t read  how about let her talk about whatever she wants to talk in her own channel
@dragon ball fans can t read  because talking bs in the comments is way better than  whining  about politics. be a man and try solving a problem instead of being one.
@a you tube commenter  she claims to be a gamer yet barely plays games.no one wants to hear her whine about the most inconsequential crap known to man.
@dragon ball fans can t read i get it  but even pewdiepie started as a gaming channel and switched up. people do that all of the time.
@dragon ball fans can t read i d say the topic i the video is quite consequential since it s targeted at children
@taylor martinez agreed.
down with the forth reich.
@dragon ball fans can t read  not only does she cover plenty of gaming news such as harry potter  elden ring  tomb raider and the like  but this is hardly inconsequential stuff as we are talking about the well-being of our children  our generation  and our spirit. melonie is a christian  and anyone who truly believes in christ will put that at the forefront when the time comes. if you have a problem with it  you can kindly go elsewhere. i m here because she s a fellow gamer and anime fan who is also a sister and follower of christ.
@dragon ball fans can t read  uh...then leave
@dragon ball fans can t read  ----john balnis bot
a group of conservatives already renamed june dinosaur month.
@dragon ball fans can t read  since you have yet to repeal the first amendment  she can say what she wants.
i m glad i m not the only thinking like this. i will not buy anything from a company that even changes it s logo to some rainbow mafia flag inspired garbage
@nathan cook  can we call it woodchipper month
@melonie mac go boom  which local farms  i want to support them too
we should have at least a month for soldiers and 1st responders  but no  we have it for the fruit loop club.
@dragon ball fans can t read   she has a separate gaming channel.  this channel is for pop culture stuff.
@dragon ball fans can t read  clearly you are troll
yes
@dragon ball fans can t read  mans born to be a hater  calm down there chief. real talk  touch grass.
this! hold the line!
make that every month tbh.
lets make degeneracy month a woke bloodbath this year.
agreed. but also let s not be too distracted with this stuff-while we re distracted  govt bankers are melting down the economy and sliding in the cbdc.
kohl s and capcom need to be on the list. street fighter 6 character creation tool is ridiculous in all the wrongs ways. today we find out that even chik-fil-a has hired a vice president of diversity  equity    inclusion. it is getting out of control.
i m so ready for this! already have farmers i buy food from  i will avoid all other shopping
it s not really fresh food but i could go nearly a year by myself without buying from any store..
why no shopping at grocery stores   target is not a grocery store.
might as well just keep it that way
@dragon ball fans can t read  if he doesn t exist why do they want him as an ally  either a  it s a pointless attempt to anger religious people or b  they subconsciously know what they re doing is wrong.either reason is dumb  but the latter speaks volumes of their true intent.
@rational ginger  that and threatening my existence is getting on thin ice...very thin ice.
they re not actually worshipping satan. they don t even believe in satan  you do. they re just trying to have a laugh because you ve all been calling them abominations their whole life. this is their way of showing you that they no longer care.
@jim slav  if a joke makes people hate you then what s the point. seems like they asked for it to me
@jim slav  it s about pissing people off they ve been doing since the 60s.
satan is not their ally. in their minds they believe he s gay but he s married to lilith. the bible clearly states they re soulless abominations and aren t god s creation.
the funny thing is that they don t believe in religion yet they believe in satan....
to be fair  they  say that. no one asked satan if he wants to.
christ also wanted slavery because in his book  he never said not to do it. there were rules about slavery in his book  but he never said not to do it.
@grand admiral thrawn  wut
@grand admiral thrawn  lol wow you re delusional if you think that.
@grand admiral thrawn  1  learn what a double negative is in grammar.2  learn the difference between indentured servitude and slavery. i ll assume those  rules about slavery  are in exodus 21 under the mosaic law  since you provided zero verses and merely commented to agitate.
@lvthor ascending  then you didn t read the book you just repeated the lines that the christian right wing told you on the news the fact that i am an atheist  and i know more about your religion than you do is kind of sad
@brian  1 it s a youtube comment section not a college essay2 literally never says slavery is bad in the bible.
@brian  correction  be smart enough to realize that slavery is a mistranslation and that it should use employment instead.
@grand admiral thrawn he never spoke against drugs either or joining a gang!
@a you tube commenter  true but the bible was written in the bronze age sooo those where not really a thing
@grand admiral thrawn  bro you said christ wanted slavery because he didn t say not to do it  what does that even mean   1 corinthians 7 21 were you a slave when you were called  don t let it trouble you although if you can gain your freedom  do so.deuteronomy 23 15 if a slave has taken refuge with you  do not hand them over to their master.deuteronomy 24 7 if someone is caught kidnapping a fellow israelite and treating or selling them as a slave  the kidnapper must die. you must purge the evil from among you.put up some facts wen you make claims. if you actually knew anything about crist and his word you wouldn t of made your comment.
@jesse fellers  i m saying the bible never says that slavery is bad. the bible never says that you shouldn t do slavery
@jesse fellers  the holiness code of leviticus explicitly allows participation in the slave trade  with non-israelite residents who had been sold into slavery being regarded as a type of property that could be inherited.
@grand admiral thrawn  your referring to leviticus 25 40-50 which states that israelites that become poor and sell themselves to there neighbor should not be maid to work as slaves. they are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you and they are to work for you until the year of jubilee. then they and their children are to be released  and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors. but it then says                 your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you  from them you may buy slaves.  you may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country  and they will become your property. you can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life  but you must not rule over your fellow israelites ruthlessly. so yes its saying slavery is not evil... in the old testament. there are plenty of example s in the new testament saying slavery is evil which was written after the old testament and overwrites many things from the old testament like pork and shell fish being a sin to eat
@grand admiral thrawn  the bible was not written in the bronze age. you are claiming you know a lot of the bible over christians but yet you say this crap. i m an atheist myself but at least i dont have this know it all attitude
@jo o farinha  did i say bronze age  i didn t mean to say bronze age my bad.
you re all arguing over a science fiction book written and rewritten hundreds of years ago. might as well be arguing over star wars or lord of the rings...oh...wait...
pridemonth  isaiah 5 20-21new living translation20 what sorrow for those who say    that evil is good and good is evil that dark is light and light is dark     that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.21 what sorrow for those who are wise in their own eyes    and think themselves so clever.
pride comes before the fall. wow  did the bible call that one or what
muslims too
target despises their customers  and they should turn into a love shop  because the sexual  bachelor  fantasy thing  of sex without consequences  is their targeted audience.  they are targeting your children.
i thought it was the love of money that s the root of all evil...
i think they love and worship money but are just too stupid to make good marketing decisions that would increase their revenue
@lvthor ascending we do need to modernize the bible for this day and age.   jesusthemotilone
@iso-didact  lol you sure love liking your own comments. tickle me.
i do question her christianity like chris pratt because of who she and chris associate with. the panels that she joins in on say a lot of devious things. nerdrotic wears a lot of satan glorifying shirt blatantly and that panel seems to be openly atheist  she actually seems to be the minority of that specific group and doesn t speak out about the offensive stuff they say  she just laughs or stays silent and doesn t rebuke them publicly for those specific comments. she also seems to be using them to propel her platform instead of other christian youtubers    all suspicious stuff to me. the blatant arm sleeve tattoo she unashamedly wears and shows off when most christian s know that isn t something anyone truly devout wouldn t have put on themselves if they plan on being a public christian figure for others to follow is a red flag. she could at least hide it with clothing like most followers if they want to show they have regret for their sin they commuting during or after their path to god. shows a lack of discipline or trying to misguide you with showing you the sign that she is of this world so to speak. she may be a good christian person after all this but it s enough proof to question her  if not anything else then because she has a platform and public and has some fan and gets celebrities to some times react to her work to gain her more popularity like in tandem. ask yourself why can t a boring traditional youtube christian have this platform that she has or the other conservative personalities who are actually christian when atheists and agnostics make up such a smaller percentage or republicans and right wings all together. that s a huge sign and red flag something is up.
@freddy es  she s actually said that she regrets the tatts before and got them at a time where she had strayed away from her faith. don t know about the rest but just because you re christian doesn t mean that you re forbidden to hang out with non believers  in fact you may just be the gateway and part of gods plan to turn those unbelievers into believers. also there s a big difference between someone who discusses entertainment and someone who discusses politics  it s always going to be harder for someone who discusses politics to build a base compared to someone who discusses entertainment  also mel has worked for big gaming companies so of course she got a big base when she went rogue
@freddy es  you re judging. you re seeing things you personally view as  questionable  by saying she agrees or supports people s beliefs just because she associates with them. i have plenty of non-christian friends  but i talk with them personally and try to peak their interest  not make a public view accusing them of being in a cult. if that were the case  nobody would be a christian or a good person. you don t have to agree with everything everyone says and does to get along. as for tattoos  that s a decision she made before being saved  are we to judge people s choices of the past  no  because that s not a christian thing to do. i m sure she is aware there are things she could improve  being a christian isn t an overnight change like anything else. i ve got plenty to do better as one myself. it takes learning and getting outside your comfort zone  especially when trying to talk about faith with other people which she does very well  maybe not perfectly but much better than i can. but christianity isn t about hiding and burying your mistakes and bad choices  you repent  you move on with it. you really think god is telling her  you re going to hell because you don t cover your tattoos .. come on man.
@highbudget  facts. i m sick of these  holier than thou  comments in here trying to explain why they re better than _ because they do or don t do this or that.
@lvthor ascending  i like melony and personally  think she s a good christian but saying your not supposed to judge is a tactic that proud sinners love to use. that very verse   judge not lest ye be judged   even tells us to judge later in the passage   first cast out the beam out of thine own eye  and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother s eye  .  scriptures teach us to not judge unrighteously  or self-righteously   to not substitute your notions or standards of judgment for god s  and to not judge hypocritically. we have every right to use good spiritual judgement. there are even several other verses that specifically tell us to judge others  john 7 24   i corinthians 2 15  i corinthians 6 2 for example.
i like ice.
@the unknown gamer  noice
i m ready!!
that s not just a target or walmart problem. the college i used to go to did the same. they had recycle containers all around the school  yet they would get dumped into the trash bin. i ve heard this is a more widespread practice than people know. the recycle containers are nothing more than window dressing.by the way  does anyone ever talk about all those masks that people wore and threw into the garbage over the past few years
the all point of it is to train you to obey. in europe too a few years ago   they got caught  all the recycling people did in their home ended up in the same incinerator once collected. a scam.
gillette lost money. disney is losing money. bud light lost money. and now  target is losing money. let s keep it going.
@gabriel  they re still doubling down   it s not just about the money to them. it s about social engeneering  they need to start becoming afraid of losing everything if they keep going down that path. eerything means  money   power   influence   dominance.
facts.
@lvthor ascending
thank you melonie for bringing awareness to the subjedt. and thats a beautiful massage about marriage. i agree with you. and yes  read your bible every day. you have to exercise to strengthen your body. you have to read to bible to strengthen your soul. bless you melonie.
i would love to see you do more political and social commentary
promise not pride
it s nice to see a christian standing up for her beliefs keep it up
i m a us navy veteran. i get one day. my fallen brethren get one day. the freaks  pedophiles  and satan worshippers get an entire month. why
hahaha  target getting some righteous justice.your hair is very pretty today  melonie. have a great day
as a muslim and convert revert to islam  i appreciate seeing a young lady from the west -- such as yourself putting god in your life and not being shy about it.what s happening is demonic  you got that right sister!
the question isn t how much are they losing. how much are they getting to promote this stuff.
i ll call you a proud  faithful christian. i want you to keep up the good work.
spot on melonie!!!  truly born again christians are the only ones actually showing love.  we are the ones telling them they are in danger and on their way to hell and showing them how they can be rescued from that fate.  don t back down an inch!
we are not to conform to this world  aka sin  but become a new creation through our lord and savior jesus christ.
i really appreciate you being outspoken about biblical values and sexual ethics melonie. it takes courage to do that in our culture now.
i must agree  pride month will be interesting.  it s gonna be a wild ride in june.
i know i m commenting a lot  but yes  marriage is something that god created for a man and woman. don t feel bad for saying that melonie  because it s true. and then all of the people out who keeps putting sex out  there for everyone to see  that should not be celebrated either. just like marriage it was created to be between a man and woman in wedlock to one another and it should remain private. and to whoever reads this god loves you and he wants you to be his.
the genie is out of the bottle. people know now that boycotts work and hurt. prepare to see a lot more.
never commented on a video once.  you deserve my first.  your courage is inspiring and your heart is so in the right place.  way to go melanie!  go boom!
with everything that s going with target and multiple corporate stuff  this june will definitely get nasty. glad you re standing your ground on what you believe! much love  sister!
its time for gods children to stand and protect children
ezekiel was all about warning people so that you didn t have their blood on your hands. your doing good work  melonie. you look really beautiful today  btw.
my sister in christ being bold as   heaven! this was really awesome to see! may god continue to bless you melonie!
amen
the memetic appeal of that is strong. you should monetize that  dude  if it hasn t already
but i believe god wins!! the good book says so   i believe it increasingly true as perversion   evil is being normalized by those in power.choose christ   his gospel while still time. that s the winning side. and thank you for serving. veterans deserve way better !
to be fair though satanism is about just living your life as you see fit and not annoy anyone. i doubt satan would like those weirdos. i even doubt jesus  who loves every human equally  would like them. i guess they have to increase the  limbo  part of the afterlife for those people. no one wants them.
because you make more money off pride than patriotism  if that even exists anymore.and fellow navy vet here.
a good analogy for different religion with the same message of love is were just using a different car to get to the same destination - god
@erwin matic  i appreciate your response.concerning love  for knowledge sake  if you don t already know. look into the historical story about when umar was first requested by the christian leadership of jerusalem to witness the transfer of power.this story is a historical demonstration about how muslims have always about christians and jews and their rights.i understand there is nuance to this from an entire historical perspective.
sorry for the misspell of your name
god bless you
sorry to hear about the losses but standing up for your beliefs is hard
who knew that making an entire month every year center around what people like to do the bedroom would eventually experience pushback....
that was such a heartfelt message. most adults are set in their ways  so it s harder for them to change.but! having evil target our very impressionable children is something that you should strive to fight for for.
thanks for urging me to read my bible again... a chapter a day sounds like a good idea. gby sis.
pride month is cancelled  it s dino month
how much more will are they willing to lose  they can t find an once of sensibility to cut back on all this craziness  let just be sure to wear our  takingtherainbowback shirts and stay strong in faith. great video today melonie s! you look amazing today!
the last time i went to target was earlier last week  just to pick up some plastic ferns from the  1 section  first thing you see when you enter the store  for my projects and i was not aware of the dark sick products target was offering...looks like i am not going back after hearing all of this...
it just sucks that they have turned the birth month of my grandmother and one of my best friends into a freak show. it used not be this bad  but as the old saying goes  give them an inch  and they take a mile.
it brings me great joy to here you talk about your spiritual awakening over these last few years. we definitely need to armor up spiritually. great video. keep up the good work!
i will not celebrate abominations.  welp  so much for melonie covering the next tomb raider game.
lol for the first time i am actually looking forward to pride month  gonna be fun watching all these woke companies finally get what they deserve
my testimony  after being an atheist for 8  years  and  married  to another female  i got the urge one day to say out loud  if there is an almighty god that does not wish us pain or sorrow  please bring me truth  i wish to know you exist . then god immediately started bringing me the answers i had been searching 8-11 years for! i witnessed him take control of my internet and the rest of my reality  he first proved to me that demons exist  i called them  inter-dimensional beings    then he proved his own existence when he didn t have to  which i later found to be jesus christ. as soon as i found jesus at the end of 2020  he immediately took away my transgenderism  bisexuality  depression  daily suicide attempts  self harm  bulimia and anorexia  and he did this all without me asking him to  because that s how merciful and loving he is! praise god! repent of your sins and follow jesus christ while you still can. jesus christ is the name above all names  and the only way to heaven. the euphrates river has dried  which is biblical prophecy  so there truly isn t much time at all. i m not a bot  a liar  or a troll. i m simply doing what the bible tells me to do. god calls all christians to share their testimony. i boast in the lord  and want the world to know the truth  that you can be saved and set free of what troubles you spiritually  if you dedicate yourself to jesus christ.
chick-fil-a went woke too
if you lose  friends  because you uphold the truth  you ve lost absolutely nothing.
hello  i m a permanently and totally disabled marine corps combat veteran. i say that because i want you to know where i come from as far as the things i say. anymore the things that i have fought for many times  and some of my friends  have died for are almost gone  slowly being destroyed by people that don t seem to care more about anything other than pleasing less than 1  of america. it s nice to see people like you standing firm in what they believe that actually coincides with the world most of us believe in god  family  love and respect. you deserve a lot more subscriptions than you have. keep up the good work you ll get noticed i m sure you are a wonderful young woman with a good heart. stay true to what you believe. i apologize. i m not very articulate anymore. my injuries are pretty serious.
i love when melonie mac goes boom!!
i m not upset over target losing money over that. hey melonie you beautiful. love the papa roach shirt. i always looking forward to your videos.
keep standing up for your convictions  melonie. you got a serious backbone. you are  frankly  a breath of fresh air.
i used to work in engineering for disney  and we would sometimes go out to the parks to help out regular guest service food stands etc.pride month was a sight. how the hell grown adults showed up wearing half-nothing leather and weird stuff to a kids park !it would blow your mind. and then they have an attitude when they re asked to change clothing. somebody wake me from this fever dream please.
keep fighting the good fight melonie. you have so many fans that are backing you up.
i absolutely agree! i like dinosaurs!
i m a dinosaur fan and i approve of this.
it s mental health month part 2
also i am a pagan  and i m against most of this madness. sorry for excluding this in the earlier post.
rofl
wears a papa roach shirt
what a testimony!! god bless you so  so much!
amazing testimony. i was an atheist but i ran into problems. when i lowered my pride and humbled myself i asked god for help with my alcoholism. god revealed his presence to me and i immediately was lifted out of my affliction.
i knew this day would come
nooooooooo!!!!
what happened
i m not really her  fan  but i support and agree with her message.
psalm 34 21-22 kjvevil shall slay the wicked  and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.  22  the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants  and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
yes!!! thank you!! the bible is very clear! you cannot be a christian while living in a sinful homosexual lifestyle marriage. god bless you melonie!! target vs walmart is like barnes   noble s vs books-a-million. barnes has a much classier and pleasing atmosphere to the eye but their stock is woeful whereas books a million has way better selection of books but it s just not displayed tastefully
target  in an irony so palpable you can actually physically touch it  has decided to really live up to their namesake
not everyone will have the heart you have. not everyone will appreciate you and what you do for them. sometimes  it won t be easy having a kind heart in a cruel world.
my birthday is in july  and with all the money i m gonna save in june by not buying from woke rainbow-companies  maybe i ll treat myself to something nice.
and great taste in music... lady  you are dangerously approaching being too good to be true. anyways  looks like the room is coming together nicely. love seeing the progress. keep telling the truth and stay safe.
god bless you  thanks for your honesty and for sharing your convictions.
they re gonna lose a lot more if they keep this up
melonie  this video and message was so beautiful and inspiring  thank you so much! from a fellow christian  3
i had a friend ghost me on facebook because i did not celebrate him coming out as bisexual. i did not denigrate him  either. it hurt that he chose to negate the friendship we had  but that was his choice to make. in the end  he chose what he wanted. i hope he is happy with it.
ms. melonie mac straight killing it everyday!
thank you also for highlighting the most precious thing we can read - the bible   where else have we to go  when the lord himself has the words of eternal life god bless you  melonie mac. go boom!
thanks!
you have to wonder how target can walk into quicksand when bud light is already drowning in it. must be nice to shed billions and move in stride.
the enemy doesn t care if they fail...their purpose was served.
melanie  preach! we support you   girl.  thank the lord jesus christ for speaking openly about this.  i m so out of the loop.  i didn t realize it was this bad until i saw the products.
target  loses money me  zip-a-dee-doo-dah  zip-a-dee-ay my  oh  my  what a wonderful day
more people need to be open about the bible
melonie is the best!
reading the bible is not always easy but i have tried everyday.  pride goes before destruction  a haughty spirit before a fall    proverbs 16 18  the devil and his minions have stepped tight into the open  not even trying to be subtle. thank you for your courage melonie. only subtle thing devil and evil itself have been subtle about is convincing people that they don t exist. may god bless you and keep you safe.
happy early birthday
she s pretty great  minus her preachy comments about christianity.
@lil poetboy  they re the best part!
melonie god bless you. keep the faith little sister.
target was too expensive for me anyway  haven t shopped there in years.  loq
god bless you my sister in christ  courage and conviction and unashamedly standing on the holy and eternal truth of the word of god is what we need.
so june is pride month  when are the months for the other 6 deadly sins  pride is the first sin  the  queen of sin  so it only makes sense that it s the first one they roll out.
i remember when i served a full time mission teaching people about the gospel of jesus christ. i vividly remember when wannabe edgelord kids would come up to us and tell us they worship satan.as if they thought that would make us shrivel up and die or something. like go ahead kid  if you want to follow a loser  be my guest.
but mark this  there will be terrible times in the last days. 2 people will be lovers of themselves  lovers of money  boastful  proud  abusive  disobedient to their parents  ungrateful  unholy  3 without love  unforgiving  slanderous  without self-control  brutal  not lovers of the good  4 treacherous  rash  conceited  lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god  5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. have nothing to do with such people.6 they are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women  who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires  7 always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 8 just as jannes and jambres opposed moses  so also these teachers oppose the truth. they are men of depraved minds  who  as far as the faith is concerned  are rejected. 9 but they will not get very far because  as in the case of those men  their folly will be clear to everyone.   - 2 timothy 3
i m not religious but i am absolutely done with all this crap everywhere  especially for an entire month  it is insane. i never cared before  it never bothered me years ago until it started getting shoved into everythere everywhere as it is now. i never cared until i was forced to care  and now its not good enough to just accept this  you have to  celebrate  it. ya  no thanks.
glad to see your stance on this has adapted to give zero compromise.
melonie  thoughts on chik-fil-a going woke   from christian to cult in just a few years after the founder died
i remember we used to joke about worshiping satan because it was fun   funny. we d have all kinds of stuff we found funny  etc. when did the joke turn into reality
i always appreciate your views melonie  and i love the 90 s 00 s hard rock band t s you have been wearing in the last couple of videos.
three years ago  i blocked every lgbtq ad on my feed. in one month  i blocked over 5 000 companies and profiles.
it keeps going and going. kohls is joining target with the same sort of merch. street fighter vi just released with a new lgbt character and it looks like the character creator will let you design any sort of trans character you want.
pride is a sin  not a virtue. humility is the virtuec.e.i.  d.e.i.  woke.simple formula for determining your boycott strategy.
i usually like to go into new york city and play music in the subway station the pride parade goes by  it s just fun watching all the folks in the rainbow clothes walking by. but i wonder if it ll get crazy this year.
melonie i ve been an agnostic for many years i use to be baptist but i ve always had a hard time trying to return to the church knowing the politics and favoritism that s i ve seen in a church and i didn t like what i saw what s the best course for me you think
everything woke turns to   1t.  - president trump
well said... don t hate the sinner  hate the sin. the problem many of the alphabet community present is that they allow this part of them to define who they are as people... they have no problem saying so either as they get super offended that you even take that approach.
so.. did you see the chick-fil-a ad  they literally just topped budweiser and target. it s bad.
melonie can you please send prayers my way  i m a young christian and have been caught in between both sides of this since early 2020. i ve been trying to change but it s just so incredibly hard for whatever reason. i know i am to blame but life has just been so bad and i hope that i can be armored up and prepared for what is to come.
never understood why an overpriced store that sells the same cheap ass crap as other stores became popular.
have a deep think to why this would be happening in the first place. this isn t normal in a society. just do some biblically sourced research  and have an open mind. crossway is a good resource.
lol christian to cult
and they still put the same ads companies on my feed...many  many times  after being blocked.if you lose  friends  because you hold to truth  you ve lost literally nothing.
add esg to the equation.
you can  i believe in you and i just prayed for you. read your bible 1 chapter a day  no exceptions  and within a month i have no doubt your faith will have increased and will continue to from there
i continue to appreciate your faithful take on these issues. put god first  and the rest will fall into place.
did you see the video where the actress lady i m not sure what her name is but she was crying because they finally took that disgusting display out of the front of the store and put it where it should be in the back of the store but this woman was crying i couldn t believe that this woman actually had a child this weird crazy human being is allowed to bring up a child it s beyond me that these crazy people are having children and bringing them up and screwing them up it s child abuse and i hope target goes out of business for this and their support for this disgusting values i ve also only ever been to target like 3 times in my life
thank you  melonie once again for taking your stance and sharing your beliefs boldly. you are an inspiration and a motivator to do what is right  good  and true.
it soo funny how they think the devil wants  friends lol. he enjoys seeing people suffering and they will be the first. every version of the devil in religion and non religion is of someone who enjoys seeing everyone suffer  even the followers lol! they always behave as cavemen.
satan is not interested in being your ally  he s trying to trick you away from god and his eternal gift.
amen! let s get ready for battle!
tolerance is not a christian virtue.
i agree with you 100 .i m a single dad with one daughter and one son. you are correct we are definitely in the middle of spiritual warfare  and as a parent  i feel it more than i ve ever felt it before because they are coming after our kids. they are desperate to take our children from us which is why  i refuse to give in or downplay all the issues pertaining to the lgbtq movement. i don t wish harm to anyone  and i hope and pray for everyone to be safe and live freely as they see fit  yet leave my children out of it.
kohl s is another one on the list there doing the same as target.
be angry  and yet do not sin.  let not the sun set upon your anger - ephesians 4 26
its getting harder and harder to hide and be lukewarm  things are coming to light as much as they are getting louder! god is in control
no one can serve two masters. we either call these things abominations and live our lives for christ alone  or we just accept the devil as our master. i m glad satan is not my master.
your episodes are straight-up nourishment and i can t thank you enough
they should have been losing this much money a long time ago.
i might have lost a couple of straight  ned flanders  types.   i don t play nice.   if we are to be more christ like....yes theres the lamb of god and also the lion of the tribe of judah.   pray and gird yourselves for both s spiritual and unfortunately a possible physical battle.  stay strong in christ!
men  we can t let melonie out brave us. stand up and be men in your own part of the world this month
normal people need to break every company that does. no more pro gay stuff for children.
let the normal family value parents unite around the world  as i do for you americans standing up against the woke esg movement. i see us fighting this anti- normal family movement by global corporations as insidious and an attack on our kids and on so many government levels world wide. we need to make using our kids a crime and punish ceo s with jail and the corporation with 10 times their years profit over 10 yrs.
isn t it ironic their name is target. hahaha. definitely armored up. i ve been ready.
hello deborah  barak here. let s do this -- armor up and go forward  you are not alone!
i agree
based
me neither
i don t even have kids and i agree
people i work with who  just a couple weeks ago were joking about the budlight boycott or barely mentioning it at all  are now actually upset that the boycott is actually having an impact and is still ongoing.
looking very stylish melonie mac like pia wurtzbach!
melonie speaks the true true
this is scary madness
i very much admire your christian stance on this issue. sadly many pastors these days aren t nearly as brave as you.
melonie is incredibly based
happy tuesday melonie mac!
the spirit war has already begun. hence why they ve tried infiltrating the churches. we must stand firm  strengthen ourselves with the spirit of christ. pride go eth before destruction.we must also remember that  no matter how many generations lose sight of god and turn their backs to him  he still loves us all and will return to us when we come back to him. we might need a kick in the rear  might need to endure some suffering to realize the errors of our ways  but every time a generation repents god has been there for them.
if i remember rightly  the last time this rubbish became popular was in cities called  sodom and gomorrah . didn t work out too well for them.
preach!
what people are going to find out is that when you align yourself and your psyche with negative energies  you are aligning yourself with a very real dark energy - it matters not one iota if you are christian  islamic  buddhist  shinto  jewish  agnostic or a secular atheist - because the energy is real and the negative effects it confers to you are real.
hi i had a discussion with someone on twitter   he trying to say it ok to be gay   all the other things   you can still make it to heaven that is 100  wrong right  i read the bible many time   i know it doesn t work that way but i can t find all the verses that talk about that do you know them   i was born disables   with my memory i can t remember where i seen those verses
also  you re not alone in thinking that things will get worse - several people i know see the same things you re seeing.we need prayer more than ever!come lord jesus  come!
no tv month.  no big deal nothing but garbage anyway.
let the pendulum swing back to truth.
thanks for speaking on this issue  melonie mac! go boom!
target  isnt down ...   stock owners are! the company could continue as is ... while the stock plummets to nothing.
absolutely amazing video and i agree with you 100 . keep it up with the great content!
also remember to drink water. stay safe. take care.  have fun.  everyone have a wonderful day.
revelations shows that all of this is leading towards the end. i pray every night and i know i need to do more to be better.
look at hebrews 10 26 about willfully sinning  which lgbt would be   as well as 1 corinthians 6 9 which very blatantly condemns homosexuality. god bless you
@melonie mac go boom  ty so much you are awesome   i always try to speak up even if i don t exactly know everything i love and care about everyone i wouldn t wish hell on anyone so i try to speak up spread the words and some verses any chance i see a situation i can to spread more awareness and to plant more seeds and prayfully god draw those closer to himself instead of wanting to be apart of the world and ty god bless you too and i knew you would know since watching you it nice to see a youtuber channel with high christian values
i need a rainbow shirt that says there s no pride in sin
i m just trying to figure out why the kids are targeted specifically...
lol  newbies. i never stopped boycotting them after they started letting transformers into the changing bathrooms and started removing bibles from their book section years ago.
satan took his sunday hat off.
it s only the stock price  which could be falling for any number of reasons. until we see official sales figures we won t know if there s an effective boycott or not.
wow much love for you speaking out on this  keep up the good work.
meh. i like shopping at target and will continue doing so. just like when people tried to cancel chick-fil-a  i didn t care since i like their food. in a few months this will just blow over and people will forget about it.
love doesn t tolerate evil. from a place of love those living in wickedness need to be faced with the truth. you ve come a long way melonie. keep jesus christ as your foundation and you can never fail.
so you say to armor up to face what is coming but what if you re incapable of sufficiently articulating your thoughts and arguments  i m not going to be able to memorize the bible. i research everything going on  i read books a lot and i agree with your own sentiments and see what s going on but when i get pressured i think i m just going to get stun-locked.
leave the children alone! amen melonie  you rock!
belt of truth  breastplate of righteousness  helmet of salvation  feet shod with the gospel of peace  shield of faith  and the sword of the spirit  aka the word of god . put it on every day!
not christian  i m jewish. but you ve revived a favour in god. tyty
love your papa roach shirt. met the guys once. they were cool af.
i m shuddering at the cringe that s gonna be unleashed in june and im gay! here comes corporate wokeness level uncapped!!!
at this rate  june is gonna be lit.  first time im looking forward to it
this goes far beyond the the pride clothing  . look into where target has been donating money for the last 10 years most people will never shop there again .
i like the new standing up videos
i grew up in church hearing  hate the sin  not the sinner   and i believe this is something many people  religious or not  just don t understand.
the boycott is working. last week i saw toddler clothes with phrases like  proud to be gay.  this week they are no longer there. they mostly sell adult clothes. didn t see the tucking suits or the satanic tshirts. i still think pride items do not belong in retail stores  gays are not oppressed  but i can overlook it as long as they leave kids out of their agenda.
thank you for talking about redemption at the end and saying to read your bible. that s something i haven t done in a while  my faith has waned and i ve fallen into sin because of it. thank you for saying that melonie it felt like god was speaking through you trying to get me back on that narrow road that leads to life god bless you sister
if you think reading the bible is only about memorization then i question if you are spirit filled. i would pray about that.nothing is more important than god
@melonie mac go boom  wow  thanks for telling me i lack spirit. all i m saying is i struggle to adequately express myself in defense so how would i go about that
they should be in a sex shop  not in a general purpose store honestly.
pride comes before the fall  yo girl  i see what you did there. i appreciate it lol.
pride month not being insane would be news.
bet their shareholders aren t feeling too much pride
it s finally there  the moment when the  pride  turns into total ubris  and the general audience is done with that shit.the lgbt grift didn t run on  acceptance   it ran on people good will  and they abused that good will one too many time.
in  this is the end   you would be one of those beamed up into heaven  leaving us all behind
cleopatra was clearly the turning point to a new age and i welcome it with wide open arms
pride cometh before a fall.we have an entire month dedicated to the 7th sin but only one day dedicated to the fallen heroes when this  pride month  b.s. is finally shattered  it will be a good day.
the designer guy is going to inadvertently hurt his cause because nobody who sees those designs is going to think satanism is cool anymore.
my own dad is trans. he came out in my childhood like chris did to tucker. my life was a mess. i m homeless now and fighting with my dad over how much it affected me.
even use muslims agree with you all as well.
as a father of several young kids  this is something i genuinely worry about. as a christian  these are things to which we need to pay attention.there s a big push to make june dinosaur month and i m all for that. dinosaurmonth
it s great to see you speaking out on this  protect the kids! awesome video melonie  keep speaking out and stay blesssed!
papa roach  really
my local target doesn t have that section. i live in an area where they won t even try that stuff. a few years ago  they tried putting a mannequin in a wheelchair  to be inclusive of people who use wheelchairs  but they quickly removed that display. i guess they were getting a lot of complaints about it  with good reason. it was just so insulting. i mean  whenever i m with someone in a wheelchair  i treat them like any other person  i don t emphasize to them that they re in a wheelchair.
cut these brands into pieces  this is their sales report! de-generation  stocks bleeding  don t wanna go where the message is leading!
hi mel love what you do ! at the end  when you say that you don t know what else to say ... i have a few ideas ...you could just say   i pray to you jesus christ to give us strength trough out these hard times and in the future  even harder times to come ! protect us from evil   amen ... cheers mel !
be careful melonie. there are a few channels out there trying to attack badmouth you. love your vids btw
leave children out of this.
don t fold  be bold for christ! yes  sister  yes.
i could use some advice. i have a hobby i love but many people in it  thankfully not all  are too radical. i m sick of seeing it and i don t support that crap but i know if i take a stand i would nuke my account. i wanted to stand up for someone else  someone who was acrually quite rude to me even  but i knew if i did i would have faced heat and the radical monsters would have flipped out and it would have done nothing in the end. plus the person disabled her account as well. i used to just live and let live but after hearing about it in literally everything it seems with no breaks it s really starting to wear down on me. i just saw today a hate filled post basically saying anyone not agreeing with all the trans crap doesn t belong in the hobby. one person even wishing death on people.
i notice there is no paladin character in diablo 4
as far as i know that is a fairly new interpretation.  pride is not only a dangerous thing for rainbow people.
it ll still be pride month for decades to come  y all won t take that away from us. stay mad.
@melonie mac go boom  shirt was more inspiring than the entirety of the sequel trilogy or its spinoffs
this just had me rollin  they know the truth  but choose this path  as christians have always believed.
i love how openly christian you are  you make me feel like feeling more open and brave towards others.
that papa roach t-shirt though
abombination  that was outright offensive of you  melonie. as long as they don t hurt anyone physically or psychologically  your rhetoric is going too far.
i think we all need to pray the rosary daily if not multiple times
def  don t support ideas groups you don t believe in.  mel  may god bless you richly!
boycott month
the pushback finally happening on this craziness is a sign of god s presence. i thought it would never happen  and i was really losing faith in the greater good. but i m glad i was wrong and that we still have hope in the world
i got a pridefest 2023 ad before this video began. blasphemy!
living in what the bible calls  abomination    so the bible rejects them and you wonder why they reject it  you reap what you sow  as the saying goes.
pride  always goes before the fall!!!!
that choker low key almost looks like a trans flag.
i completely respect your views as a christian and like and support you. however i don t know how i feel about notion of just completely removing the pride section out target for example. of course i don t believe that there should be items marketed towards or sold for children. however i don t see the issue with there being a section for adult people to purchase gay pride merchandise. if one does not like or support that then i feel just simply don t purchase or go into the pride section. this is america and is supposed to be a place we re people are free to live however they want and believe in whatever they want to believe in. i think we should stick to making it about keeping it away from children and not trying to control adults living in america.   love you tho girl just my 2 cents
next month bout to be lit
how did they get june for their wacky predo-feelya shenanigans anyway   any expert will tell you that june is wildebeest appreciation month.  and people are supposed to parade down to their favorite watering holes and try not to get eaten by crocodiles.
i agree with you completely and you motivate me to work on building my faith up even stronger.
keep fighting the good fight -------
you called it! your video explaining wokeism is satanism is spot on. that video was mind blowing me me  but it s true!
maaaan  that satanist designer reaaaally looks like he is enjoying hanging around playgrounds.
these weirdos are so fixated on putting real women behind them so these men can be in front of the line again.
it s in the bible  point blank
ironically  reap what you sow comes straight from the bible...but god doesn t reject them. he rejects the sin they re living in. god wants no one to perish but for all to come to repentance. there s not a single gay  queer or trans that god would reject  but those gays  queers and trans people need to turn from their life of sin.sadly  many will choose staying in sin over god.
i d like to be a fly on the wall in some of those corporate meetings   bud light and had a huge loss  should we possibly rethink    no  they didn t do it right. we ll be fine!
i used to love going to target with my mom because that s where we d get bionicles at  remember those  . that s why for a while i called it  the bionicle store  as a kid.  now target is babylon  basically.
thats pride month. call it for what it is................ demon month...............
i  understand  what you mean   i thank god i found your channel i do struggle just to read my bible.sometimes
extremism experts  lol we live in a wild time
i dont understand how people use religion as a reason to not like something. it s part of the reason i really avoid religion. i just wanna live in peace lol.
exactly tolerance didn t lead us together  it let to this.not a practicing christian  but i can read and words have meaning.if you chemically physically disfigure a child  purposely  to stop them from completing human growth - stopping them from becoming a full human...the word abomination becomes impossible for any well-meaning adult to simply freaking ignore. insert obvious asterisk for the actual few that need intervention help
i still wish melonie would get scene by someone in the wood and cast her instead of jenny ortega as lydia deetz daughter for beetlejuice 2!
i ve been listening to mike bickle on prophecy  end times.  i ve come away from his teaching with more than i thought i would.  he believes that in the end that there would be a falling away as well as a revival.
but this will only continue if people continue to boycott. stock folks are predicting stock will be back in  180  in 12 months.
love  ya  mel. thank you for spreading the holy boom.
based! this girl gets it.
pride month is cancelled  june is dinosaur month.
i love your level of faith and messages melonie -  go boom .  i am quite surprised at the number of people of christian faith that i know that think things are about to get really bad in the world - at least seeing jesus would be awesome!
experts say target is boojie
stay strong  sister. i thought i was the only one who was expecting june to be a battle.
amen! i will meet you in eternity.
we re just gonna forget the fun line of products for kids from celine dion....
how does one become an  expert  in cancelling pride events   asking for a friend lol
so intelligent  insightful and  compassionate. glad i found you again after youtube de subscribed me. thank you.
i find it amusing that with walmart with all it s problems  it is target not walmart embroiled in this. walmart being smart enough so far to stay out of it and just rake in the cash. walmart may have strayed from it s roots but sam walton and ol  roy would approve.
accepting and coexisting is one thing but having it forced down our throats is another. its never enough for them  and they are digging their own grave  the normies are waking up.
16 50 - melonie taking the words out of my mouth. good to hear
revival . pride comes before the fall...
17 46 he was the same god  before  the same god now  and the same god forever
we all have different rituals.it s getting defined at town hall right they re not getting married in catholic church s by catholic priests are they keep the parents there ands kids will be okay. not sure why youtube deleted that last pat
a man s way looks right in his own eyes  but in the end it leads to death. safe them from death and show them life  show them jesus  be loving as him  but call sin  sin.
when people have so thoroughly eroded language  removing all meaning  it s no wonder they get confused when you re very clear with your words. keep standing and speaking truth.
amen sister. stay true
your perspective is so refreshing. god bless you melonie!
still though i ve never bought any clothes from walmart or target cheap behind clothes and fabrics to begin with
a lot of us have not been in a target in over seven years because of their restroom policy.
preach it  mel!
bible contradicts itself every second page anyway  using it as an argument is a terrible idea.
you know it s hard to believe that with what is known  that people can still be atheists. that life is somehow random!   this is the equivalent of a tornado going through a junkyard and somehow building a city. there are most definitely higher forces at play here. and i think you are on the right track m .... god keep you
thank you brandon economy for making boycotting easier!
thanks yeah i had a similar conversation with a friend ..
the budlight boycott gave people assurance that their wallets have more power than the wallets of investment funds. now the ball is rolling and the chopping block is slicing away.

you ve clearly never studied it. it s one of the most historically and archaeologically accurate books on record.a proper analysis of history and archaeology  when applied to even just one book  such as the book of acts  demonstrates the following - the date of pentecost is accurate  relative to passover  2 1 - the regions and provinces that are listed in 2 9-11 are all correct- affirmation that pilate ruled over judea.- specific names of real people  such as the pharisee gamaliel  mentor of saul   paul  is found to be accurate  5 34 - it s determined that candace is the name of the queen-mothers of the ethiopians and dynasties are named after her  8 27 - ethiopian eunuch fits historical narrative more than fictions portraying ethiopia  8 27 - letters authorizing arrests of jews in damascus fits the council s authority  9 1-2  see 22 5-6 - military commanders are titled correctly  10 1  22 24-25  24 23  27 6  etc. - the flat roof where peter prayed before lunch is accurate  10 9 - agrippa sitting on a judgment throne or seat is accurate  12 21  cf. 18 12  17  17  25 6  10  17 - agrippa putting james to death and imprisoning peter fits agrippa s character  12 7-12 - peter s escape through jerusalem conforms to topography  12 7-12 - josephus confirms agrippa died after public adulation  12 19-23 the book of acts was written by luke  the same luke behind the gospel of luke. even secular academics credit luke as being a careful  first rate historian. if luke was so accurate with acts  why would he discredit himself by falsifying an account like his gospel the gospels prove jesus is god - sinless in every way. so since jesus is sinless  do you really think there are any errors or contradictions in his word no.but there are plenty of human errors when it comes to properly understanding the word in its intended context and historicity. fortunately  melonie understands it fairly well. using the word in her arguments is called using the best source of wisdom there is. there s nothing terrible about using such a historically accurate book.
dude.can t thank you enough for what you re saying in this video especially around the 10 30 minute mark.  god bless!!!
preach!!! be light and salt sister!
i love  you
frosk got a job at target and came up with a brilliant idea.
melonie mac.you are awesome.i  believe in you
important question  what is papa roach s best album
you re seriously awesome  melonie mac. keep up the good work  i admire you.
what s your gender according to the colors of your choker
if government weren t involved in marriage the alphabet people wouldn t want to get married.it used to be that if a couple were to be married they would be required to announce it in the local newspaper within two weeks of the ceremony and have witnesses present.
i don t think homosexuality is a sin  although  pride  is and i don t understand why we need a whole month of it.
i m against them pushing this on kids too  but none of you better push any religion on anyone under 18 then or else you re hypocritical. i d say anyone besides your own kids  but i ve seen too many religious people saying that they should be punished for pushing it on their children. i feel the same about your religions. christians and the woke are the same in my book in that regard.
if the only reason for the change was their employees feeling that unsafe than why did target remove the items from their website  the crazies are losing the culture war and they know it.
i cringe during pride month. as a gay dude  i never asked for this.
i loved your channel before  but seeing that you re awoken to the whole spiritual warfare aspect of what s happening  makes me love you even more!
@melonie mac go boom  hi again really sorry for bothering you he actually responded again   this is what he said man is imperfect  flawed  and fallible. god instructed man to write the bible. men wrote the bible. it is men s interpreted words about god s instructions. the bible is flawed. quoting the flawed text to prove it isn t flawed  is flawed.imo i don t think that is right i believe god instructed man to make the bible exactly how god wanted it to be with zero mistakes do you know if there anything in the bible that say anything about that
diablo 4 coming out while we also fight the forces of evil irl. devine serendipity much
this is happening because people left religion. satan doesn t attack those who are strong in their religious convictions. those who don t have enough faith have brought this on themselves and their children.
i would call you cute
fun fact. if you believe in satan then you are in fact a christian satanist and is embracing the christian religion. real satanism satanists does not believe in satan nor any god. in original satanism  humans are the highest being and there exists no gods  basicly satanists are atheists . satanism is a description of a lifestyle and the reasons for the naming is cause the founders was against the commandments seen in christian religion. so if you believe in satan then you are not a satanist but a christian satanist since satan doesnt exist in satanism
and people wonder why young people are leaving the church
because not everyone is a brainwashed christian who believes loving yourself is a sin. the world doesn t revolve around the bible.
kindred spirit. i was prideful for about 2 years and i got bored. like it s not that big of a deal
even when not condoning sins  most people have sinned against the lords commandments or commited one of the deadly cardinal sins so that we must just accept if we don t want to live like a hermit.
cut my heart into pieces
everything that goes up must come down empires fall time is a great healer patience is a virtue
the wokith  must go brokith. so it is spoken  so must it be done.
stock being down means nothing.  what matters is next quarters earnings call
experts say. who are these experts  why is their expertise so valuable  what have they done to make money or have success in the field they claim to be experts in  why should i trust them more than my own common sense those are the questions you should ask anytime you hear someone utter  experts say.
i think people are just getting tired of having lgbt shoved in their faces. and all these companies glorifying a sexuality which to me should be private but we cant have privacy anymore we have to wear our entire identity on our sleeves. not to mention i think the majority of people got sick of it when kids started being thrown into the mix.
the pressure needs to be kept up thru the month of june  at the very least  if this is going to have any effect at all. boycotting bud lite was an easy choice to make  target will be much harder to sustain. it will take discipline and the willingness to be inconvenienced in order to make a lasting difference.
tomb raider is also a gay icon with a large lgbt fanbase just sayin
hey  melonie i just want to say that you look beautiful and lovely today in this video for today. also i have to say that i hate shopping at target and it is a bad store to shop bc they got not much to buy at the store and it is a bad place to shop for groceries and other stuff like that. also i am so happy that they are losing billions of dollars in money bc they are so terrible stores to shop and their employees are not so great people and they are disrespectful employees to ask questions for at targets items and other things like that. anyway i just want to talk about the situation bout the target store and i just wanted to make a comment about this video for today  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and hope you have a good nite too melonie. god bless you melonie.
our god created the universe. we have nothing to fear or to be ashamed of.
exactly   why are we celebrating people having sex   why do i need to know if and who you are sleeping with
agreed stand on the word of god
i m reading the old testament also and it seems most of the kings preferred sin over following god. i m just hoping more men chose to follow the lord god  commander of heaven s armies. yes men  i m calling you out! you re suppose to be the leaders and protectors and we women do follow after your example so if you re going to sin  women will sin too just to be validated by y all.
all this talk of threats reminds me of a very important  and in my view criminally under-shared  lesson. proverbs 4 16-20   for they sleep not  except they have done mischief  and their sleep is taken away  except they have caused some to fall. for they eat the bread of wickedness  and drink the wine of violence. but the path of the just is as the shining light  that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. the way of the wicked is as darkness  they know not at what they stumble. seems pretty clear there  it is important to understand that this does not apply to the whole  but to each individual. a person chooses which path they walk  and that choice is theirs alone.
melanie mac go jesus
hi melonie! i m curious to know what your stance is on salvation. how does one get saved according to you
sis  even a lot of gays i know don t care about pride month  even me  whos asexual... sure i ll have no problem saying  happy pride month  to the next when needed. but this....leave kids out of this
hi me
jesus is the only way  you have to accept him as your savior and turn from sin
@melonie mac go boom  thank you for your answer but i  have to respectfully disagree. jesus can t be the only way if you have to turn from sin at the same time to be saved because that is a work and works don t save you. good works give you extra rewards at the bema seat but they are seperate from salvation. salvation is a free gift that cost jesus his life and god the father his son. we are saved unto good works  not by works. as christians we should do good works after we re saved  when we believe in jesus  death  burial and resurrection which is the gospel as stated in 1korinthians 15  1-4  but they are not required when it pertains to salvation otherwise you partially trust in jesus and in yourself to save you. the only thing you must do is believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved. nowhere in the bible does it state exactly how many good works you must perform. repent means metanoia in greek  which means to change your mind  change your mind from unbelief to belief. from not trusting in jesus christ alone as saviour to trusting in jesus christ as saviour. romans 11 6  and if by grace  then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace. but if it be of works  then is it no more grace  otherwise work is no more work . romans 4 5  to him that worketh not  but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly  his faith is counted for righteousness .
i m 30 and divorced myself so this question isn t meant to be rude or mean i m genuinely just curious-- divorce  from what i remember  i was raised by christians  is only really an abomination to catholics  right  i know you ve mentioned you re divorced a few times  and just like the tattoo thing  i m just genuinely curious!
i do not like how the lgbt...community have taken a natural wonder  the rainbow  and  used it to represent their alternative reality that they are creating...i like rainbows for the natural wonder they are no one has the right to claim one of gods creations as their own or as a representation for something they believe in .
god will destroy us all if this keeps going on. evil is getting way out of hand.
i m not even very religious and i still think this is totally wrong. kids are far too young to know what their identity and sexuality is and they shouldn t be exposed to this kind of depravity. this is something you should discover later in your teens and you shouldn t make a big deal about it. wanna be gay  be gay  just don t make a spectacle out of it. wanna be a woman  be a woman  just don t expect everybody to accept you as a woman. there are only two genders  male and female  with exception of the very  very rare few people who are born intersex and have to decide which one they are. this lgbtq  thing  especially transgenderism feels more like a trend than anything. people in our society are so starved for attention and need to feel seen  so when lgbtq  people get attention and are celebrated people get drawn into that movement. they want to feel special and unique so they get pronouns and say that they re this and that and expect the rest of the world to conform to them and even celebrate them. basically it all boils down to people being egotistical and narcissistic.

luv your voice and expression meanlie mac
dei translates to  god  in the singular  deus is plural .  anyone upholding it  is using it as a  heaven on earth  depiction. it is the beast antichrist.  it is meant for the state to be the replacement for god  and wokeness is the canonical doctrine and liturgy.
as a kid i lost my favourite uncle to hiv in the early 90 s he lived a sinful life as a gay male. we prayed and with the help of a priest who did work in the lgbabcd  community. he came to know jesus s he found he was worthy  he repented and although he lost the battle with hiv he died with joy in his heart. it was beautiful.
women voted for this and now look what we have. chanhe my mind.
progressive christianality is still christianality
i went to best buy today. target is next door. i never seen target s parking lot so empty.
for those of you on the fence about what mel is saying  lookup david pawson and genesis. instead of watching some useless video  take some time  watch that instead and keep an open mind.
we need to call it  protect the children  month and deal with these predators.
pride month
is lara fighthing
more like died month
05 48 anybody care to help an old mexican understand what  buyi  is
satan defination1  the angel who in jewish belief is commanded by god to tempt humans to sin  to accuse the sinners  and to carry out god s punishment2  the rebellious angel who in christian belief is the adversary of god and lord of evilthat about sums that up huh
there are biblical grounds for divorce too  but if someone divorced even the wrong way  they can still be forgiven. divorce inherently is not a lifestyle sin unless someone just makes a big habit of it lol
not necessarily. the ones that preach against the bible are false prophets
those predators you re talking about are more than likely to be a family member  teacher  priest  or person in position of trust just so you know.
@gloria thomas  clearly it is much wider than that.
the money doesn t matter to them. the immediate profitability is not the bottom-line for this.
christians  hey leave the kids alonejudaism  hey leave the kids aloneislam  hey leave those kids alone buddhists  hey leave those kids alone hindus  leave those kids aloneagonistics  leave those kids aloneatheists  leave those kids alone unite against grooming
spot on!!!!!
come on man   right on with your thoughts   but your driving my nerves to the end     adios
i was with you until you got into the religious nonsense  i guess i am in the middle stuck between pride crap and religious crap
melanie i think you re crazy and i stand with you!
boom!
im an atheist and dont believe in sin or any supernatural bullshit but biologically speaking there is no advantage to being trans or even gay. its purely a sexual preference and should be kept behind closed doors between two consenting adults!
let s make it  100 billion for target to lose.
how do you feel about adam s first wife  or that the new testament was written 300 years after the person with a j name that never existed in the hebrew language died melanie should try reading her bible one time. i was forced to read mine three times front to back and christian school before 6th grade.the least you could do is practice what you profess to believe in.... but that s a lot to ask for with your  my body is a sacred temple of which i have defaced with graffiti  cognitive dissonance youtube stalking invitation grift you ve got going on.

if my  transphobia  keeps children from being influenced and encouraged to change their gender  then so be it!

i don t doubt that satan respects pronouns.
pride month is going to be volatile but their barks are worse than their bites so i say let them try
i hate that i was born in june and the month has absolutely been taken over with pride trash.
all they had to do was leave kids alone.now they are a step away from getting the woodchipper of liberty coming out

i am happy to cause more expert tears in june
pride before the fall.
turf nation home girl.

pride cometh before a fall.
i think i agree but i can t hear you!

what s in the middle of the words pride   sin  i.
if you  lose  friends  because  of your beliefs  then they were  never  you friends
nice shirt
stock has nothing to do with revenue.
i feel boycotting them will not be good for the employees who work there trying to make a living and might lose their jobs over it. am i for this agenda no. but not boycotting them and people lose their jobs over something they didnt want to participate in. just dont buy the gay stuff and keep it movin. i gotta buy a coffee maker and an air fryer thats on sale lol
i was even saying last night that next month  some of these pride event may get shut down or worse  because  people are that sick of it.
he said this is what happens this is what happens with bud light teaming up with dylan mullaney bud light loses billions of dollars and losing their customers. and i have the same thing what happened to target  this will be a civil war 2.0. i mean how many look at they doing to children and men  mocking women and girls. people to stand up and say enough is enough i mean  if peoples stands up to them because normal people i had enough of this  too.
will never spend money on anheuser  nike  adidas  disney  hershey  target  gap  levi s  gillette  blue states.... complete divorce.
