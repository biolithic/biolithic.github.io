hope you know this channel has been reported for hate speech. and trust me  from personal experience this will get taken down. and i ll be back on your next video to take it down should it literally make fun of a marginalized group. have a mid day.
not trans. she s a woman. a spider woman.
gwen stacie is not trans at all. i don t know who would ever come up with that idea why can t we just leave superheroes alone why does everything always have to have some sort of label on it it doesn t make any sense i understand having a voice for this or that  but not everything needs some sort of label. let kids be kids who are adults be adults and make their own decisions
they need these headcanons to feel good about themselves
gwen trans  that s so dumb. they have to try and ruin everthing. i hope you have a good day melonie
character  existstroons  one of us  one of us.
this is really getting ridiculous honestly. they think that because of the poster in her room which is stupid. do they not know who gwen stacy is  if not they are not real spider-man fans. i loved the movie but my god.
i wouldn t be surprised if some trans artist snuck the colors in but this is a strong reach lolat most i d say the colors just looked good together lol
actually i noticed something regarding the colors...when gwen was alone with her father and she snaps at him for trying to comfort her  she is green  her hair is green  her clothes are green  we can tell she is being  toxic ... but when she finally gives in and hugs her father she is suddenly in full color. same happens on a later scene with the same father daughter struggle and they show her dad all green when he did not wanted to face his daughter.
this feels like a timeline that dr. who would eliminate or fix.  back when dr. who was a good show.
not gonna lie  i feel like they might come out and say that she is even though they never planned to. also the trans colors are on the sleeve of his uniform on the left side of the screen shot
this trans flag color thing makes my eyes roll every single time. i m so goddamn tired of seeing them jump to conclusions from a pallette
love your energy in this! definitely made me laugh too!  it s funny that they re bringing cops in this too. like saying it s illegal to be straight and white now. fun!  great video today. you look amazing too!
it s true gwen s not trans  but it is pretty much confirmed that she s a bbc lover given her relationships with miles and spider punk.
looks like they re jumping to conclusions again
oh for frick sake  these people are starting to get ridiculous because all of us know gwen isn t but there are always people who insinuate that a certain character is someway something else thanks to their  evidence   which is honestly rather annoying
oh my goodness. melonie s background also has trans colors!!! what is she trying to say ! !
character breathes air  troons breathe air  character is troons. the logic of the movement.
these darn decepticons!!!
i remember my grandmother saying to me  i don t care what they tell you in school  gwen was trans.
what a baby
@iambilly  no actually  just standing up for a minority. making fun of a marginalized group  that  that s what makes you a baby.
@yamikat  i m not a baby i m a grown adult  you are someone who can t take criticism and wants to silence others.
i m literally shaking rn
@melonie mac go boom

freaky alien genotype!
lmao criiiiiiiiiinge
spider trans. lol
transpider
shouldn t it be  girl  isn t she young in these movies
@rod  spider man started as a young person in most iterations i ve seen tbf  and i think she s 17 in atsv
isnt she spirit spider now
....so ..trans species.
@chihiro kikuchi  ghost spider yes
she  a female 100
@chihiro kikuchi never heard that  it s usually spider gwen  spider woman  or ghost spider
@rod  by that logic  peter should be called spider-boy  but no one wants that. it wouldn t even make sense anyway.
because some people are insecure narcissists that need to feel validated unfortunately.
she gave birth to twins!!
she s also my wife and gave birth to my kids
@indigo wild  fair
the thing that s narcissistic is that they say  even if you don t believe what i m telling you  you should at least pretend you do   or you re a bad person.  but they never extend that kind of entitlement to others.  if you reply   well  i believe something different. can t you respect that    the answer is   you re a bad person . anyway  they think words are actual violence  and actual violence is freedom of speech.
@alice bowie  nailed.
@alice bowie  based
nah. they just figure if they push it hard enough  that the writers at marvel will just cave in and make it happen.it s the same thing that happened to iceman. if you were on comicvine  you d see a new post every day  writing about how iceman should be gay and all of the non-existent headcanon that proves why.these people are ufckin annoying.
@alice bowie  that s spot on. i  saw troons saying the same exact thing about nia from xenoblade 2. who quite clearly isn t a transformer because you even play as her daughter in xb3. it s nauseating because all conversation about the game revolves around troon fan fiction that has nothing to do with the games lol
bahahaha!
gooble gobble gooble gobble
they are like the fucking borg lol.
@red dragon which is doubly funny since most of them will claim every gynnoid toon character is one of them.
do you think normies read comics really    don t misunderstand me but i ll just be clear. i remember when i was a 8 year old kid with tons of social anxiety and loved comics overall not just  american comics  altough these ones where my favorites and of course the vast majority of stories that i kept on the inside come from them  the best part is that i m not an american but a geek who love science fiction who knows more about comics unlike those dudes from that country . but then the normie nation attacked and a bald man called  kevin feige  make his own factory with the golden egg chicken. again  don t be surprised if they re the same people who thinks professor x and the master of magnetism are  martin luther king  and   malcom x   cause that s a myth that shouldn t exist.
getting  this shit has been ridiculous.
agreed
isn t her creator mtf
@dj tenders  isn t that an scp thing
@pasalasaga  male to female if ur not joking.. if you are.. the creator is just bout as scary as some of those creatures or entities
i saw someone point out that the  flag  on the uniform is actually a row of medals ribbons like you would find on any uniform.
thank you andrew
@melonie mac go boom  you re very welcome!
everyone has preferences.  not sure what to say.
yeah  it doesn t look like it from their skintight costumes. more like they got micro-pen.
apparently  joan of arc was also trans . . . .
autobots roll out
one shall stand  one shall fall!
decepticons attack
how are you unicron cybertron and all it s moon s belong to me cyclonus or scourge remember we belong to him galvatron in agonizing pain i belong to nobody i will obey unicron
dayum  not even a couple of seconds in and melonie already has the brass to call the toon-brigade what they really are.now that s what  stunning and brave  really looks like
it s funny cuz the more they try to attach trans labels to things that aren t it loses its meaning more than it already has been lol
with the current landscape in western media  it wouldn t even surprise me if the director or someone on the production team made a public statement saying  yes! you guessed right! this was completely intentional! give us woke points please!
i agree with melonie. why do you need to project yourself on everything. the worst part is that these woke hollywood   comic book weirdo s will probably make this a reality just to score diversity  equity  and inclusion points
no iteration of gwen stacey has ever been trans aka a biological male that became a female. ever.  by the way  she had the side head shaved thing because in the first film  miles couldn t turn off his power when he touched her hair and they had to cut it short to get miles to let go.  remember the line  you don t get to like my haircut
now that the thought is out there i m sure the executives will make it official in the next one.
i like how we ve all gone from compassionate yet opposed  to just mocking their profressively worse delusions.
wear  use  or have something that has pink  blue  white  or some similar color  which  you know.... covers 2 out of 3 primary colors  plus a basic color  transgender.strong  brave  kickass women  you must only love women  you can t have a man for a romantic partner  no nuance considered. i also like how by this logic  they can t even wear trans flag without being trans now  even though they want people to show support for them and fly their flags.i m playing a game that also has these twitter shippers. can confirm that here  they re also completely crazy like this.
what angers me is that in the next spiderman miles morales movie qwen stacy might actually become trans because they are sending disney the message
they feel that they must be exactly like them  yet they miss the full meaning of character development and how characters are supposed to relate somewhat to maybe not all audiences but some audiencesfor example  i would relate more to miles when watching spider-verse. meanwhile  i might have some relatable experiences with gwenand to make matters worse  half of these crazy fans honestly probably never read the comics nor have noticed that the color pigments are kind of like this on the covers
i m pretty sure the colors around gwen is literally her color pallet. like her color of her suit and normal clothes and they add those colors into her perspective. people need to take a chill pill. maybe like in shakespeer  i think its shakespper   sometimes it s just a red door.
melonie is the result of all the gods coming together  with the intent of creating a perfect human. just saying.
everyone raise your butter in salute! melonie s here with a spicy new video
the snarky way you re read some of those tweets  that s so true  why do they always get so made at us for being christian and our beliefs. yes reading the bible is very important. amen to that.
so when do you going to realize they will do everything in their power to piss off all fans. the only way to deal with it is completely ignore them  but that doesn t make great videos i guess
stupid.  that was funny. don t be afraid of being banned. you just keep speaking truth.
i saw the flag in the beginning. that s when i noted   this is going to ruffle some feathers .as for gwen  she is a woman who cares for people. if you want representation  well make you own characters.
so what s the headcanon fanart like... is it gwen with a five o clock shadow
thank fuck you made this video  twitter is something else
would love to see you play some older games on stream
in regards to dad s uniform  they are probably talking about whatever is above the police patch  on his uniform shirt  on the left of the picture with him you referenced.
last time i was this early that wall crawling menace  spider-man  hadn t ended poor gwen stacy s life yet. daily bugle  get on it  i want pictures of spider-man!
i thought i was the only one who called them that!!!! transformers more than meets the eye.
don t miss the after 14 00 part of this video  it s worth it
honestly i don t know gwen stacy all that much but if she s a trans ally cool but with everything i ve seen on twitter  tiktok  etc. i believe its all reaching unless some writer writes it out then ill believe it.
narcissism at its finest.  they have to have everything be about them
so you are saying she can t transform into a truck im sad now lolalso the big butter caught me off guard
i didn t think that gwen stacy was an autobot    xd
we own colors too.red.. white.. blue
haha the thumbnail  made me laugh cause i read it in your voice
did that say cyborg spider woman  is that a thing we asked for
you know they are gonna be like  hey  great idea and swap her over lol!
they already made the other version of her asexual so yeah  they probably will make her come out as trans in the third movie. these are the same filmmakers who intentionally made miguel represent the critics of miles.
thank you for being real
god  we need jesus no more than ever.
they tried to do it with samus on  metroid
utter bs the animators said in an interview that they got her color palette from the covers of the comics she first appeared in. had nothing to do with trans stuff.
i give it a week before they say she s at least bisexual. watch.
lol she put a giant stick of butter in her spare room of solitude. free laura croft from the buttery spare room of solitude. gwen stacy just looks like a modern  based emma stone from the live action movies.
they own white  blue and purple  uh oh melonie  with your colors today  better watch out!
amen!
now
absolutely
you just read my mind
trans supporter not just  trans  only because in her room appeared a phrase that states  protect trans kids  or so. anyways just remember what happened to jumbo carnation. kid omega was right.  surely we can t express ourselves without hurting anyone  or something like that.
yep  retro gaming for the win.
i actually like the idea of the first black spider man who was the first spider man to be chased by an angry lynch mob of the first diverse spider men hooking up with the first trans spider-man and being shown the ropes by the first mom spider-man to have the first spider man abortion in the first trimester. best pride ever  such progressive
tuck n roll out transfromers more then meets the eye!  just thought this up!!!
can you talk about how barbie is supporting pride month and did an official pride parade and have a trans character in the movie i m obsessed with barbie but don t wanna support any products now which is sad
lol if she s gonna be miles morales love interest i ll be all for it he s the one character that was created for the soul purpose of tokenism thus the one character i don t give a damn about they can flag him to be the gayest thing out there and i wouldn t bat an eye
now the  trans  community has claimed link from legend of zelda who i might add was not intended to be trans cuz japan being japan and men in japanese games are designed to be androdrunes  to make them more interesting for the japanese consumers.
wokies headcanon everyone trans  even jesse pinkman from brba  so i m not surprised they went after gweni m more surprised they also didn t go after miles lol
melonie keeping it real like always!!! these spiderverse movies suck anyways  you are not missing nothing.
that was great keep up the amazing job  and on that note nvm you have a great day
these people really need to learn that gwen stacy is not trans and just because their head canon says something in a piece of media is true that doesn t mean it is.
do you like the yakuza like a dragon games  mel  they ve been keeping me sane with this woke insanity lol
honestly the whole trans thing is just one of the reasons i decided to skip this movie  the second being its  ending   and the third being the way they characterized miguel
i love the giant stick of butter in the background  haha  butter queen.
dam they reaching from here to mars with this one lol
i ve not seen the spiderverse movies  so maybe things have changed but wasn t gwen stacey originally peter parker s girlfriend  doesn t making gwen trans also make spidey bisexual  i m so confused.
they must be playing halo  because that s a reach.
honestly this annoys me so much. they take someones random tweet and run with it like it s fact. gwen stacey  spider-gwen isn t trans and never has been. but god forbid a person or fictional character can t wear certain colors without the alphabet gang making it all about themselves. i just hope marvel comics doesn t jump on this to gain woke points. the last thing i need to see is marvel officially reconning gwen into being trans.
i kept getting distracted by the massive stick of butter.
anyone remember a movie called pcu  these people are the cause heads. they find a cause  and stick with it ... for about a week.
all my life i thought entertainment was supposed to be an escape from reality. oh  and remember to drink water.  everyone have a wonderful day.
protect trans kids  these snakes  its really  project trans on kids
what the fuck is wrong with twitter these days
all one has to do  logically  is show the people claiming this some comic books. logically.
transformer tho would be cool
they made it to the matrix too - suddenly  when wachowski brotherscame out as trans  suddenly the whole trilogy became alegory to transitioning...you can interprete art however you want  but your point is as much valid as swastika s miles morales costume reference  p
i as a black man still watched it. once it comes out on blue ray i will see if all those subtle images are in there.
something  something   starved from human touch and emotion to see it as this
this is the truth  no  you don t have any right to rebut or enter intelligence in this conversation! i m right! i m always right! good grief.
the woke troops are out in force lmfao
hey melonie  you missed one nerd movie. turn in your nerd badge. those last 30  years of dedication didn t matter i guess
if ya smell what melanie mac is cookin
i m a woman... is what i would say if i was deluded.
and it s not as if the stories about characters who seek to be accepted by their parents haven t existed since the dawn of time ...they confuse the message intended and being recognized in the message .i have no problem with headcannon but when it becomess an obsession and showing some people narcissism when they want to force others to accept their point of view as the only truth and the pov of others as invalid ...and gwen story is mainly about guilt and grief but the only thing they see is   wow trans gwen !
shout out to you melonie. question the author of the article and the sources of their information. i agree with you. sounds like a bunch of woke bs...
when you going to put some positive videos on your channel mel
there is a term for it  apophenia. instead of seeing real world and accepting  those people create their world of delusions and do their best to fit real world into this delusion.
the left projects. its what they do.true fans don t need headcanon.
the difference between the fnt crew and melonie it s that she s never giving this studio her money just so they can keep spreading child mutilation propaganda. thank you for being a real one melonie  you re better than them for sticking to your believes instead of giving excuses as to why you need to see the movie like they did.
so where did ya get the super butter stick at
i mean no disrespect to the fnt crew  but sometimes it s better not to see a movie out of principle than to say   but we need to review this movie for our viewers and i need to put food on the table.
can i get a butter explanation  an explanation on that butter  because your never gonna get an explanation on why these folks stay goofy as all hell  lol
link is trans  ff7 has no concept of gender  and now spider gwen.  the level of insecurity and crazy of these people.
giant butter!!
hahahah transformer!
lord help us all.
actually  i don t get hugo boss vines from miles morales - inlikectge nod to stan lee s brand invention of allitteralism. i said he invented it!
baby go  boom you speak truth
they are desperate for attention
chronically online
all the more i praise and thank god i m a normie
i have no idea how these people come up with these ridiculous theories. hahaha
is this because of gwen s hair  that is stupid. miles pulled her hair by accident because he just learning about his spider powers. why didn t her hair grow back  that made no sense. why is miles still calling her gwanda after knowing her real name.  telling her real name to his parents doesn t reveal she is a spider-woman. wtf!
looking very stylish melonie
all i see is butter pillow.  luv the setup.
good. that s what miles gets for being thirsty.
gwen stacy gave birth to twins!
saw a meme the other day  can t post it here  obviously npc 1 - i support the current thingnpc 2 - i oppose the current thingchad - i support the one true   eternal thing.
i  staying away from this movie because of how political it looks  it s very political. but this is why i been gate keeping the pollitics out of the video gaming community.  because i really don t want that trash in the video game community so it can be ruined. in all honesty  the comic book community has become very political and so have movies  and music.
how much blame do we take  i m talking about normal people. without social media  the crazies would stay in their own bubble. they certainly make for good content. crazy weirdos usually do. but we wouldn t think they are as prevalent as they aren t if every creator wasn t farming them for clickbait content. laughing at them is one thing. treating them like they have legitimate observations beyond their own crazy  isn t beneficial for anyone. seemingly  they can t even wire their mind with their own body. why would anyone listen to them for opinions out in reality
peter parker would not want a dude in makeup. if anything  he d  make fun of a villian for being one.
wow i have to reassess my priorities now. that sounded based.
haven t seen it yet  but hearing there is no ending and 2 hours long time to get through dramatic sequences. tells they are running out of ideas.
they really digging to find anything ...but then again tumblr and shippers...
the movie was so good!!! definitely the best comic book movie of all time and my favorite spider-man movie
9 01 - 10 20
gwen stacy in the comics isn t  but this one might be. this movie was made by far-left activists  so the odds that they intended for her to be transgender the whole time and just cut the one line of dialogue where she confirms it  out at the last minute  to avoid a backlash after the budd light thing  it is very high. her dad wears a literal trans flag on the shoulder of his uniform and if she got put on puberty blockers at age 10 which is their ultimate goal for  trans kids  then she would sound and look exactly how she does in the movie. i just can t see that they checked all of these woke bullshit checkboxes and has zero lgbtqrstuvqq2s shit in the entire movie.
if you have the opportunity to watch it  do it for free. do not pay a thing.
these people are evil
lords and ladies  the  wokies  have struck once again. there s a reason that it s called head-canon  it only exists in your head or my head. leave us not forget  this whole discussion is about  wait for it...a fictional comicbook superheroine  as in gwen stacy is not real.
8 55
jesus is king
the writers literally stated that gwen is trans. do research plz
omg.. she said fire emblem!!
lol at the spider man nazi meme
i am still saddened that they would rather appropriate a fantastic female superhero  inspired by a tragic event that happened to spider man then make her trans instead of  you know  making their own characters... oh  wait  i recall a snowflake and safespace and how terribly that did. hmm. correlation edit to add    let people have this   is code for   we want a participation trophy.  bruh. if you can t argue  and i say that in the term of debate  your point  you can t  have  anything. you didn t earn it. if the trans community wants to claim something  then back it up with data and fact not   let us have this.  it s borderline pathetic.
if they made her trans in pt2 it would end up doing so bad.
yeah that s why i skipped the movie.i have zero tolerance towards woke crap because once you start catering to them here come the headcanons as we have seen here
a year later  the entire visible spectrum of light now belongs to lgbt
miles morales be like  everyone s telling me how my story is supposed to go! nah  imma do my own thing! words he would say to those tweeters i guess.great video  melonie mac! go boom!
i would ve seen this movie if it wasn t for the trans kid signthat was too much
i saw videos on internet thats show that she is a woman
she sounds like hailee steinfeld to me
i m not gonna watch it at all
@melonie mac go boom  just saying.
no they didn t
mid morales  across the wokeverse is extremely overrated  trust me you aren t missing out.
these people are crazy.
this head canon from the mentally unstable is getting ridiculous gwen stacy is clearly black
i kinda hope she is... it would be hilarious
the trans and left political agenda is in the film. i wouldn t be surprised if they say the character is trans later for extra points.
i pray that all these people will come to know the lord instead of looking to be validated by the world. because at the end of the day this world and those who continue to uphold for sin and push all this stuff  they really don t care about who they say they care about. if that makes any sense.
i m just surprised they allowed her to be caucasian.
do these pinheads not know what a tomboy is
cis is a pejorative  it always was and we absolutely have every right to find it offensive. they mean for it to be.
i don t even know what to say  i keep losing braincells everytime a trans open their mouth or  typingand yup i have been playing older games alot recently myself  too much woke bs in modern games atleast most of them do  only a few modern games don t do that
melanie are you going to see songs of freedom
it takes a special kind of stupid to demand that everyone else on earth accept your personal self-insert fan-fiction as canon ... i m talking to you kathleen kennedy  mindy kalig and the entire writing staff of she-hulk  rings of power and willow!  let s toss in blood origin while we re at it.the list goes on and on ... if you really  really need to  see yourself  in everything  just walk around holding a mirror up in front of your face  btw ... the shiny side goes towards you .
not watching any movies anymore unless i know there s none of this crap in it.
robocop is part man. part machine. all cop. buy robocop instead
you know  for someone with an established channel and making such content  that is a display of bravery. god has made male and female  whatever sprouts out of that norm is breakaway of the regular structure of our dna and natural behavior.
wow  they are unironically the meme with the exasperated guy in front of the wall full of clues... what grind my gears is that the reasons why these people like miles morales and splatoon gwen stacy is so blatant  so  in your face   so artificial and they feel no shame about it  fascist propaganda have this  means to an end  mindset where the art only exist to cater to the message. quite disgusting.
i guess she is trans  spider
i agree she s not even the trend if she was a trend them. it was an already by now and knowing that miles could have a gay relationship if that happens.. she is a woman and this loser to their account private because they don t want to face backlash  which is already happen.
fire emblem engage has better battle system but weaker story than three houses.
across the spiderverse isn t really worth watching. its only an okay movie  the plot is super flimsy and falls apart when you think about it for more than 2 seconds. it doesn t surprise me that this type of discourse has already gotten a grip on the fanbase  stuff of this nature is all over the movie. one of the main spider-people is a 7-8month old pregnant woman. i ve known a lot of women who ve been pregnant  most of them stop being able to get out of bed on their own by month 6. the indian spiderman  despite being in a world where indiana colonized the new world and new york is new mumbai  claimed the british stole all their stuff and freaked out at people calling chai tea  chai tea  and not just tea. the punk spiderman is an insufferable prick who likes to firebomb policemen and thinks theyre fascist  and gwen and miles still like him anyway even though both their dads are cops. the memorial for miles  uncle who died in the first movie is clearly a george floyd reference  with  rest in power   a black racial supremecist slogan  written on it.  so on and so forth. the movie was mid  at best a 5 10 on its own  but easily a 3-4 10 with that crap.
there is more to being a devoted christian content creator in her community than that.
even so that breakaway can represent the glory of the work of his hands.
most people enjoy it for what it is an entertaining movie. you clearly didn t go in to have fun but make real world parallels so your opinion means jack
butter!
movie was incredible.
lol  baboons. i really miss the days when a dude in a dress was played strictly for humor.
gwen stacy is a actual woman she s not trans. she s straight too she dated spider-man. stan lee and steve dikto never had spider-man dating a biological male that wants to be woman
who cares about gwen  think of all the characters that are now retroactively trans. pink panther anyone
this once again shows that you cannot please the woke mob.  this movie literally tried to please everyone and include nearly every form of diversity imaginable while also having good parental figures.  sony even caved to the blm and protect trans kids signs.  and it still isnt enough.  they had to claim gwen stacey is trans because  woke  tropes.  how broken of a person are you that you need to head cannon everything to make her as you need her to be and not what she was written as   after seeing the movie  most of the parts i saw were fine aside from the agenda based things and the way they portrayed peter parker and jess drew.  but i reallyhope we see things turn around pretty soon cause this is disgusting
miles morales is spider-nazi
still not watching this movie
same reason why i m not gonna watch it
i m not even going to watch this movie. i hated the first. the multiverse stuff is ridiculous.
i hate they do this. and i hate that i need to be ashamed  these people suddenly turn you more radical about your believes!which i think is cool somehow. have your believes! but it seems like the right suddenly sees gay people als second class people again and turns on us.im trying to find to god by each day. and i try to limit my sins to just the tiny amount im to human for to change. i love my boyfriend and want to change to a better person for him  and for all the people around me  also for myself ofcourse!i completely despise the whole gender bullshit  and fight against the transaagenda day by day.im absolutely pro family and also want kids at some point!this whole mess and those agressive people just destroy everything!ill hope you dont hate us all melonie! there are good people that happen to be homosexuals and dont reject god and his beautiful creation!
i don t care how subtle  the message  was  i know it s there so i ll give it a pass.  i don t see many movies any more these days anyways.  movies used to just be fun  or at least the movies i remember fondly growing up in the 80s.
one more comment  sorry i comment as i go along  dude  i grew up reading wolverine comics  because i wanted to be  just like him  i didn t want him to be like me. a little fat kid who s lazy ass stayed home reading comics  instead of riding bikes with his buddys  it would be a boring comic  so now  that s what they are doing  and guess what  they are freaking boring! lol aaaand the comics industry tanks.-thank you for coming to my ted talk.
the f ck
another laughable effort to appropriate a somewhat popular character  gee where have we seen this before fanfic shippers take obsession too far and damage canon! iceman  robin  superman  etc. how are those comics doing by the way
fire emblem three houses a legendary masterpiece  i mean  i loved the characters and played it for over 400 hours but that doesn t mean i can t admit that it s not that good of a game objectively. i didn t play engage yet but to say that three houses  a game which i think screams 5 10 all in all  would be a legendary masterpiece just shows me how little of it you probably played. this game is way too flawed to be an actual masterpiece.
since gwen stacy is not trans in the comics  then she should not be trans in the films.and i know there s a possibility somebody would argue alternate reality  and that the film version is not the comic book version but the fact is you re adapting the comic book version and also most of these films don t care about the comic book version being the main version of the character. that s why the mcu calls their universe 616  even though the main comic universe is 616. that s  why even though the comic book spider-gwen is earth 65. spider-verse gwen is earth 65.so since they re adapting the gwen stacy from the comics who is a regular woman  then the gwen stacy in across the spider verse should stay. a regular woman .
are you kidding me  another movie i have to boycott. i swear if i see one woke thing in the next spider-man i m quitting marvel.
honestly i don t care if she is cause she s not the real gwen stacy  she s just some cheap multiverse knockoff
you re allowed to be wrong
so is spiderman a trans-insect man    gwen stacey is the cute  smart girl next door.  stupid revisionists.
this isnt even funny anymore or gets me mad it just.... sigh exhausting.
firsties!

i have no interest in head canon or fan fiction.  and to the racists and alphabet fascists  get your own damned fictional characters and heroes  stop trying to headhunt ours.
spidergwen is 100  trans
