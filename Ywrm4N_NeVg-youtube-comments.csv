lookout for scammers in the replies. this is happening every single day to a number of us youtubers  we can t stop them all  just know no youtuber is going to randomly ask you to text them for a prize. this shouldn t have to be stated but alas lol
people fired over unproven allegations should be able to sue for unlawful termination.
no one is going to watch rick and morty without roiland  he s basically the show.
when stuff like this happens they should just suspend relations until there is an actual verdict.
there s a big difference between  charges  and  prosecuted .   studio should have waited until he was found guilty before cutting ties.
we were promised 9 more seasons of rick and morty. rick and morty forever. we were lied to
this is why i follow the whole not guilty until proven. a lot of people these days can say abuse which is something you should never lie about. these people who cried wolf about being abused ruined it for those who really have been abused.
so much for innocent until proven guilty.  you think they d wait until the conviction.
the show is not going to be the same without him.  he was basically half the show  writing and voicing the most important characters.  no way they maintain the same quality and character without him.
they were pretty quick to fire him  it d be crazy if turns out he didn t even do what s being alleged.
it s not rick and morty without him. innocent until proven guilty indeed.
i ve heard more about him getting fired than about what is alleged to have happened. guy is hilarious  and i have a hard time seeing them getting a replacement writer that can duplicate that. sucks to see him losing his job without seeing proof. i don t think i ve seen depp in anything since his lawsuit even though he won.
im going to miss rick and morty. it was my favorite show ever. it has gone a bit down hill lately but is still my  1. now... its dead. so sad. i have very few show that i still watch and now even less.
i agree  if the allegations are true then he show be removed. but we don t know. and we re supposed to be innocent till proven guilty. but it feel like the opposite.
gotta tell ya  the newer white text in the recent thumbnails really stands out. great editing work  melonie
yep this is the right take. could he be guilty  absolutely. should we assume he s guilty without seeing the evidence  absolutely not!
this event happened over 2 years ago.  i am sure there have been many conversations between him and his partners since then. they waited until he was actually officially charged with a crime. they probably made a deal in anticipation of this.
the actual messages he sent to 15 16yo girls were up on reddit the other day. it s quite wild. they did the right thing. guy can go and get help
definitely a good approach to things  and i wish people would be more reasonable like this. people always assume a side with little info...
this justin roiland situation reminds me of the way the board of norman osborn s company treated him in the first spiderman movie. he founded the company  and yet they were perfectly prepared to throw him overboard. i also seem to remember that the film did not end well for the board members.   out  am i
been reporting 2-3 per day lately
i seen you after them in one of my comments  you re an og for that!
i try to report them. hopefully that helps
r.i.p. rick and morty
we ve got our flyswatters at the ready to bash and report  em
youtube shadowbans half my comments but can t keep obvious spam bots out of the comments. this is ridiculous.
i love you. don t worry i m not a stalker. i just love you from afar.
oh shit really so im not getting the flatscreen tv  total balls man
so melonie it is possible they did an internal investigation and legally can t say he was officially charged and sentenced for the dv and unlawful imprisonment
shameless flirting  i know you wouldn t do it  because you re the prize.  to everyone else reading  this needed to happen  just roll your eyes and move on  d
agreed  yet another failure by our ever so omnipotent lawmakers lol.
@insanefuriousflames  this kind of worker protection would be socialist by nature. preeetty much the opposite of a free market  i always thought the us americans would hate that beyond anything
@falsebelievers  americans have a divided opinion on that subject.
chandler burse  i understand that. i just simply love to pick on the dichotomy when i see it. i like to do that generally  to point at hypocritical ideals. the stronger one feels against something  the more i like to press down on it when i see a hypocritical argument. doesn t matter if it s with us americans or anyone else  myself included. one of my most annoying and  at the same time  one of my best traits. forces myself and people around me to actually come up with a good argument instead of the usual black and white string of arguments we so often see around us.and regarding healthcare  you know  i don t think free healthcare is a must. i mean  from my pov it s preferred  since i live quite comfortably in it and actually pay less than the average american  for more service. it s more cost-effective and still more than lucrative for the healthcare industry. noone should need to fear the bill of an ambulance and noone should need to fear that the doc in the hospital you re at is an associate not covered by your insurance. that s outright predatory and evil tactics.doesn t need to be universal healthcare  i don t like to use free healthcare  cause it s never free  it s just a question of how the money gets managed and how far 1 unit of money carries you. just healthcare that s worth it s name would be a good start. would probably bring the us out of it s close to third-world country image  too.
trust me i know a guy  not personally  who was thrown under the same bus as justin  fired for allegations yet to proved  and lost his carrer for it he tried to sue for defamation but lost  because the judges in texas are incompetent as fuck and so was the guys lawyer  5 years later and even though he s trying to move on to continue his carrer those who hated him  including cancel culture  are still trying to get him banned from con s and make sure he doesn t get a jobi wonder if you can guess who i m referring to
chandler burse  mhm  it s the results of politics that leave the impression of a third-world country  not that it s actually is one. also it s not the capitalistic part  i m german  we are also quite competent in regards of capitalism. i mean we have the 4th highest gdp with a nation half the size of texas. i also get the taxes part. we vastly overpay for an inefficient  almost dysfunctional bureaucratic system. we could so much better and handle our taxes way more efficiently. which in turn could mean not needing taxes that high  but we still want that noone needs to fear poverty  or illness regardless of circumstance  which makes overpaying is a solution  as long as we have the money and the system somehow runs  which it often enough doesn t anymore.   i mean we do know that you guys have the most advanced military by far. how couldn t you  you throw more money at it per year than the rest of the world does together. in terms of user technlogies  the us is also front row. also there s an understanding of the sheer size and diversity the us has in populace.but then we look at the numbers of incarcerations  poverty and the political divide resulting from that 2 party system. oh yeah and the on a regular basis happening internal terrorism  school shootings  where your kids rather get a psa to zig-zag run  or get bullet proof rucksacks. in that regard you re not looking that great  rather poor.  the abstruse black and whiteness in the us in a few things is fascinating and i thoroughly enjoy talking with americans visiting germany  as well as i do enjoy this conversation. it simply gives me another point of view to consider into my perception  which is something i genuinely like. lived together with a few us americans and had have great friendships with them  mostly because i m curious to have someone that can help me clean up my media driven perception of the us. didn t help too much  though. probably because i get a skewed picture. most people traveling here to live or study a while are usually more left leaning than conservative.with the heavy divide you seem to have on a political level  i don t get much opportunity to get a fair picture of the conservative side and as we know  the internet usually isn t a place to get a good conversation  to get a better picture. there s a good conversation once in a while which allows me to change perspective a bit  but yeah.with the wars in the middle-east you guys made yourselves rather unpopular  too. kinda the same standing putin has. you have nukes  better to cooperate. but then again  we do have a clash in sentiment about the us between the people and the politics. our politicians love you  on the people side of things  russia  china  usa  not much difference. none are friends  not anymore  albeit actually honoring your contracts and promises in defending ukraine gave you a boost in likability  since we wouldn t expect you to honor international treaties  after your last president has kicked and shat on the treaties that were in place. that and the spying on us a decade back  really crippled our relationships. china was a more of a trustworthy partner than you for quite a while around here. so actually honoring your promises made  helped  not much  but a bit. helped a bit to offset that we had to shoulder the humanitarian crisises you were responsible for in the middle-east.i hope you understand where i m coming from with this. just want to explain why the perspective comes to be.
why isn t that a thing
you mean pewdiepie does not really need my help !  i don t even know who i am no more
roger that.  whenever i see these obvious scam accounts  i report  em.
if they wanted to really save face in the way that public plus still keep him on the payroll they could have suspended him with pay or suspended him without pay or suspended him with diminished pay and still look good in the eyes of the public still show that the you know they re waiting until the investigation is done. they totally jumped the gun  and if the charges are found unwarranted or a jealous wife just trying to get money inhope he sue s. but if he did it they can fire him  say they gave him a chance and let the law have him.
@the_mask  eyes were rolled  laugh was had.  good work.
so you mean i won t get that free boat for my social security number and bank info
i report every scammer that i see
i report each one i see.
i been getting scammers on both channels. but  i think this man is getting the wrong end of the stick. i did a video on this myself  and the fact they are hold up his work is just stupid  because  nobody actually  knows the truth.
gotta say i ve never seen a youtuber give away anything without announcing a give-away first off  secondly  they usually advertise said give-away in the video description and or within the actual video itself up until the time when the winner s  are announced  usually via a youtube video or pm which will likely be private and not in the comments section lol.
haha  just received my  prize comment
how do i know this comment isn t a scam
they almost hit me a couple months ago. it looked like it was you rewarding me for being so funny in the comments. they were giving me a ps5 and i was stoked. but very quickly i realized something was strange. they ll ask you to hit them up on telegram and then they start asking for personal info and a credit card to pay for the shipping. and they have a handle and pic with your name and photo.sketch city
and they re hitting me up right now again!!!
he was fired bcuz of this on top of the multiple grooming allegations on top of the resufacing baby r sketch and the child m cartoon and the 2 podcasts where he said he would get with kids as young as 13 if they were fully developed. plz dont defend this creep
i have been getting these messages from it last couple days after i gave you my comments on your videos but i just don t reply to them and i just gave you my thoughts on your videos  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to let you know that  ok melonie. anyway thanks for let us know that. hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
@davidthompson1888  nobody defended him. but the show is dead without him. no way they can keep it at the same level that he maintained it.
i ve received scammer messages in comment sections on numerous channels over numerous videos over the past few months especially.  best advice  when you see one   report it to youtube as a spam message.  it s unfortunately all one can do but then it s in youtube s court after reporting the message to actually do something about it.
i report every time i see
4 00 if true  right  even srs charges have a range.   in relationship  idk if youve seen  but often thr as bad as each other  ihmo xp   but if convicted  sure. well  he ll be in jail. bxches be crazy. we all know one. @ least. 100  dv is bad  it is not just that simple tho. and as you said  we re in the 3rd yr since the charges were filled  why now  _jc
@jcresdoc94  i read a bit into mr. roiland s situation online through various news sources.  according to the information i gathered   what mr. roiland is going through with this dv case is that it s a case where the investigation started 3 years ago in 2020.  the case s records though were sealed by courts from the general public up until very recently.
i mean it doesnt have to be random though
yeah  if you dont text me  no prize for you suckers  the mystery is how to find my  .
so that s was a scam
join antiscam
wait  so... does that mean i m not getting the brand new playstation7 that the reply text said i won
how do you report these losers  i just had an attempted comment pretending to be melonie.
hey melonie  you should review each episode of the last of us as it releases. really enjoyed your episode 1 review.
for the crowder vs dw thing  check out shad s nights watch video covering how vile that offer was.
i encounter them often  however i just ignore them
what would be perfect is if one of the scammers replied to this pretending to be you.
yeah to me it was obvious enough  i mean you have responded to my comments before. but thanks trying to get ahead of it.
youtube doesn t care about this  but about 70  of my very clean  and carefully worded comments get shadow banned  and my favourite channels can no longer make the content their audience wants because of tos violations the algorithm thinks happened.
@the_mask  the stalker
@usernameash  lots of em but if it s not from the authentic youtube account of the creator it s  a scam
my youtube name used to be noob noob

so it s another johnny depp ans amber heard thing
@falsebelievers  right! people are so quick to call out what they don t like about the free market until it effects them. its not cancel culture  its a business decision to cut ties.
i mean ........he still is able to sue them if they did indeed unlawfully terminate him.the fact that he hasn t sued or announced his intention to do so should clue you into how confident adult swim and hulu were of their decision to terminate him.
@emberashes6809  vic
@uwuowl  correct
the right to sue over a contract being broken by one party isn t socialist. contract protections are key to the free market and like one of only three things i think the government should actually be doing  as a minarchist. now if his contact was  as is common  at will and with clauses that either party could walk away at any time  there are no grounds to sue  but many times actors and producers do have multi-year deals that can t be broken so he may have grounds here. likely they invoked some morality clause but dubious to do so over merely an unproven allegation.
@falsebelievers  in the form of anti-discrimination laws  yes. an employer has a right to practice their association in business relationships as they wish. the way this ought to be tackled if not or instead of as a criminal dispute is a civil dispute in court  or privately if a former employee can make a case that they were wrongfully terminated which can point to a violation of contract.the real trouble in an increasingly socialized legal system under a leviathan government isn t that government courts somehow are able yet stumble in defending employees from contractual business relationships through assuming that employers are inherently in a predatory position. that s merely an anti-property rights position. the trouble is that through laws that assume as much about employers  hired legal workers and teams within corporations work to game the government court system instead of actually protecting their clients.from a price point in generating revenue  there s just more incentive as a lawyer or even as a judge to drag out cases brought into court. more time  energy and effort of businesses and the legal system is spent less on advancing contract theory and forming better or independent contracts that could be specialized to fit an employee s unique needs with an employer. instead more capital resources are put into protections against a legal racketeering system itself.what both employers and employees fear in court even if they re at odds with one another is the weight of government convictions by an appointed judge weighing down on them. government as the saying goes is simply too big. or rather government court systems are inherently socialized services  which make them prone to attracting agents who see extortion as an incentive to remain and preserve the legal status quo.
@pjopitz  they shouldn t  it should be common ground throughout.
and deformation of character. until proven true.
the two creates have much worse allegations against them.  they are the lowest of the low.
