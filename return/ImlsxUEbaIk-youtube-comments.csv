hey melonie.I am not religious at all  but even though I dont share your faith you seem to be doing the best out of it.your verse readings and interpretations show that you are a genuinely good person who cares about others.keep ignoring the haters  Im normally much more vulgar than this  Im making an effort here   you ll do great.

as a man of faith  though not Christian  I have to applaud and agree with your point about not being a pushover.

never did I think when I joined this channel would I be getting a Bible quote of the day. Ive always had a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to church  I was apart of one of those really judgemental churches growing up  but I feel like this is helping me want to stick my toe back in it. so thank you melonie  and God bless thank you.  just found your channel.  boy did I need to hear it and youre  making an impact on others.  I hope you dont stop any time soon.

Im going to church for the first time since before the lockdowns  thank you for the inspiration!

I needed this verse of the day because Ive been going through a bad break up and its a long story but I saw my ex and my ex bf and seeing them made me feel defeated and sad but then youremind me that God is always with us and Ive been doing good by going to the gym hanging out with family and friends and also been serving at my church God is good
