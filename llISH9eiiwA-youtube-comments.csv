why does every charater need a love interest  why can t we just have a fun game
are you telling me she could have gone for avad  drakka  nil  kotallo  teb  petra  erend  talanah  or one of the million other people she flirted with  but instead she flies to la and goes after the first random chick she meets
the wild thing about this is  the people doing this think they re stunning  brave  and doing something groundbreaking and amazing - even though  it s been absolutely done to death.
honestly  did aloy even desperately needed a love interest. why can t she be without love interest and still be straight woman  why does she need to be lesbian  seriously  this woke non-sense destroys everything it touches and this is no different. you nailed it with this video
been noticing this lately how so many modern western female protagonists have either been lesbians or bisexuals or simply excessively demeaning against male side characters  especially white male characters. and you re absolutely right. only game devs i ve noticed that bothered to make attractive female characters tend to come from non-western studios like capcom and so on. often japanese studios  too. this tragedy is also constantly occurring in other forms of mainstream entertainment. for example  in the music industry  we re getting force-fed lizzo in the western side of things. thankfully  i can still enjoy attractive women in k-pop  don t worry... i know many don t like k-pop . i m a filipino dude  and i used to hate k-pop  too. glad i decided to actually try a few of  em out.
i feel sad for my boys  erend and or varl. two fantastic choices that could have been included in player choice in the sequels. two men who stood by and backed up aloy through so much crap. heck  even sun king avad  even if a bit creepy  could have had an optional quest attached to him to help shape up his advances and respect aloy as a person 100  before he becomes a valid choice would have been neat.
if they were going to introduce a love interest in this game  would have been nice to have it based on the players choices with a few different npcs so the player can float there own boat.
the original lara croft  while not perfect by any means  was such a huge inspiration to so many people because she represented how powerful an individual can be by harnessing one s innate beauty  intelligence  and strength to overcome any obstacle or situation that presents itself in life. plus  she showed that it can be fun whilst doing so. although it was somewhat interesting at the time to see a completely different iteration of her character  what exactly has she been representative of over the past decade  victimhood. there are few words to express the level of apathy and sheer boredom that has resulted from the homogenization of interesting personalities that are now being turned into a genderless blob of nothing to which the audience is force-fed.
while i was playing this  i felt like this love interest came out of nowhere and was pushed at the last minute. it didnt make any sense. aloy spends around 2 days with some random girl and falls for her. it would have worked better if this girl was in the last 2 games  game and aloy got to know her over time. to me aloy had love interests  avad and erend as they both expressed their interest in her  especially erend  they ve known each other for years and fought along side each other. i was hoping erend would have turned up at burning shores at least. big mistake by guerrilla games.
they went the assassin s creed romance path...never go the assassin s creed romance path lol. also the big take away for me from this was that for a game that usually allows you to influence aloy s responses to things like this  they really force the feelings and flirtations without any player input. only at the very end are you given a choice
i like that there s an option to have aloy not to fall in love with a girl but why couldn t there be a male love interest choice instead a  female or single  choice
that s what i ve been thinking too. that lesbian romance between aloy and that asian woman just felt so forced and shoehorned inin addition  throughout the story i ve always noticed how aloy and that asian woman constantly have to be complimenting each other and telling each other about how much they re the best in their tribes and everyone else is lucky to have them. i just can t help but smell that woke  girl power  thing the entire time
nobody writes hero motivation correctly anymore. male or female  the compelling motivation for becoming a hero is to protect other people  see batman  spiderman  simon from gurren lagaan  and deku from mha . the way the west writes characters like this today comes off as the character wanting to be idolized  or that they re just naturally good  which is not a thing . that s why it never lands with the audience.
a lot of well written awkward moments for comedic purpose in the first game came from the fact that aloy was very   asexual   ... if this is not forced  i don t know what is...
zero dawn and forbidden west are two of my favorite games. i thought aloy was great because her focus was on saving the world and protecting everyone else. she s a very self less and obvious badass character who had no interest in a relationship with anyone. her sights were focused on the task at hand and she knew relationships will weigh her down and distract her. which i liked. what ashley burch says  who is insanely woke like most at guerrilla  said that in the forbidden west story is that aloy realized that taking it all alone isn t the way. they already had a perfect match for her. erend. they ve been through loss together and many battles and it shows that erend really likes her. hell i even thought varl would have been a good match too but they killed him off. erend was the only character who could have been with her. now they introduce a completely new character and make aloy completely break a character that was built up as a selfless individual and fall in love with a complete stranger  all to virtue signal and show  hay everyone look at us at guerrilla . it s insulting. also definitely predictable. as soon as i saw another female character in this dlc i was like  yup. they re definitely making aloy fall in love with her
in the first to horizon games  they had hints in dialogue with  aloy and erin  along with  a king. there was always dialogue choices that went with the flirtations.. which shows at the very least  the heroin did not dislike men. she s just focussed so much on her mission. carrie ann moss plant is it a an antagonist in the sequel who loved elisabet. she took a fancy to aloy since aloy  had similarities. but since there are dialogue choices with both genders. i thought it would ve been interesting. if the heroine had the option to say  listen i m just not into girls. given what the dlc is revealing  those options have been most likely taken away. being a straight female lead is considered abnormal nowadays.
i actually enjoyed the fact that aloy just didn t really entertain anyone when it came to romantic relationships as she was too focused on literally saving the world.  why can t she be a protagonist that just isn t interested in that type of stuff   why force it
aloy s design in genshin impact is still my most favorite design of her.
my boy eron deserved better. he was there for her the whole dang time and yet. we get this shit.
companies   we hate that  our fictional characters look better than us. i know   let s fuse it with phantom of the opera.   company exec.  that s a good start. any way we can make character even less attractive to our fans      love interest   with  gasp  someone of the same gender  thank you for all that you do melonie . you are a beautiful woman. may god continue to bless you and keep you safe and well.
the funny thing is  fans of the franchise had been wanting some romance options for aloy for a while. the game claims to be an rpg but it isn t really  and aloy doesn t have much of a personality so they kind of answered the fans request in the worst way possible. why not just have male and female romance options like an old rpg like dragon age or mass effect
nope  the studio will be forced to create game for  modern audiences  today.i heard that next atelier series will be less sexy.
@hostmann socrates  i hope we have options. because at the moment it looks like an attempt to get you to eat raw potatoes when you paid for the promise of a full meal.
@yudhi adhyatmiko siswono  seriously  this franchise was literally making tons of money  getting more and more fanservice with each new game. ryza literally became a meme thanks to this.
yes! this! i just want to kick some butt and wind down at the end of the day  not deal with emotional stuff
@andrewfantome  they are serious  next one will be  different . that news come from koei-tecmo itself.
hogwarts did a good job.  no teen drama.  just the adventure.
my thoughts are the same.
@yudhi adhyatmiko siswono  this sounds absurd. yes  i ve always been openly salty about the franchise going into full fan service instead of the more story-driven games of the past  but it still looks like a strange decision now.
@yudhi adhyatmiko siswono   went woke a little wile back the stink is there ive seen it in some of there dinasty warriors  ect . so yeah and they will flush the alterier series down the drain. just when they found that nitch.
it s the la effect
@mr anderson  lmao. came to say this
yup  no romance development . this was pushed
but instead she flies to la and goes after the first random chick she meets  the chain of events with seyka last the entirety of burning shore s run time. hardly a  first random chick.
right ! ! i m about 2 3 of the way through zero dawn  and i thought  for sure  that aloy and varl were gonna hook up.  the chemistry between the two is nuts.
@victor valenzuela  less pushed and more just poorly written.also you can reject her you would know this if you actually played the dlc.
not only the first chick  also the possibly most annoying companion on her adventure  you as aloy trying to get a sneaky kill  and that crazy new girl jump and screams to destroy your experience on all fights. what a pain
this new breed of strong female hero  the mary sue  needs no love interest  we can t imply that they need anything other than their own greatness and perfection in their lives...unless it is another girl.
better yet why gay romance
or why cant it just be a normal healthy relationship that isnt the focus. we need more depictions of straight and healthy relationships that arent focused in men being  abusive  or just bs drama.
love interests is fine but this is forced af.remember geruila boss knew kneel cuckmann.i m betting god of war is next with loki aka atreus and i m not holding my breath for uncharted 5.
it s funny zelda is a game where the main goal is to save the princess. it s kind of a love story that s been around for decades. thing is every zelda fan when talking about the game talk about favorite dungeons  favorite play style  puzzles you solved or enjoyed. nobody cares about love intrest in games! it s something going on in the background or a motivation to keep going. but twitter people need to be pleased i guess...
because muh representation.
what the heck is with that character s hair
this!
samus has entered the chat
well said  stephen!  i just want to play a game without sin being shoved down my throat.
i know right  because giving a character a heart and their own personality and identity is so lame in a narrative story character driven game
lol i finished typing it and scrolled down you said it just make the game
so the game isn t about just hunting metal beasts anymore  just finding a new girl to scissor  bummer. don t even want to play forbidden west anymore.
because of the message
the message
agreed. while i could have seen her with errend or avad  i just always felt like she was just more of a free spirit. i don t know why they thought this of all things was necessary...
@gabriel duncan  yeah it s such a unique personality  that s why it s becoming so laughably predictable at this point.like when the tomb raider leaks say in the next game lara has a female love interest  the entire entertainment industry is pushing in this same stupid  woke direction now.it has nothing to do with giving characters unique personalities  it s all about pushing their own agendas into their games movies series.
although im straight i dont bother  at all watching  two women kissing  or something more you know.
agreed
if they made frogger in this day  the frog would be made to fall in love with a car in a cinematic story.
if they made tetris now they d say the blocks are lgbtq.
let s be honest here. if they had hetro love interests none of us would care. let s stop lying to ourselves we all know the real reason this bothers us all. same reason why i will never play a last of us game.
that s how i feel about dragon s dogma. i just wanna kill a dragon. not have the japey dude from the hotel run into my arms uninvited.
@dave and his death beanie  wait never played that but i ve had it suggested  but it has gay stuff in it too
re had love interests  leon clearly likes ada. there s no problem with it and fans love it. when everything goes woke and forces it is the problem.
in my opinion it kinda humanizes them and alot of the time gives them an extra reason to do what they do outside of morales
no  that question can wait! why tf does every woman in media need to be a lesbian ! like... all of them !! like  we don t see this with guys  it s just the chicks. why  why every time !
tree lover s neeeed some rep-re-sintation
next crash bandicoot and spyro the dragon will be gay.
i agree they always do the same copy and paste crap.
horizon  the scissoring cliffs
there can be love interest  yes. heterosexual love interest that is. that s what 98  of people want to see.
there s always tetris.
@yudhi adhyatmiko siswono  i just started playing this deck building game called griftlands  and only one guy is available to use at the start. so i play through several missions before one of the characters in the game refers to him as a her.so i look it up and apparently it s a female  but you would never guess it in a million years. it s 100  a picture of a guy  being identified as a female. it s so stupid.
wait until mario and luigi start having a gay incestual relationship...
they did it on last of us 2.
r.i.p. horizon2017-2023you ll be missed
wonder how this was pitched boardroom member how bout welike have them be girlfriends and stuff boss  wouldn t it like trigger folk boardroom member  i ll be fine whatelse could go wrong
samus aran
because of anita sarkesian
thank you.
@ark lyte and continues to be so in forbidden west. but well...play on.  sigh
they should change the name of la to los diablos.
@kelsonarwhi  love how you people are conveniently ignoring that you can reject the relationship  but hey anything to fit your narrative.
thank you i m like damn i don t even like her
@cody connor  love how  you people  are conveniently ignoring that she could never accept one before  because reasons . but hey anything to fit your narrative.
eww  how could you put teb on the same level as the rest of those characters  he literally has only 2 or 3 lines of dialog in the whole series
@semantical man  i know  i know  he isn t my favorite either  but to be fair  he and aloy have mare history together than her and seyka and he is less annoying.   _   _
more specifically  why can t we just have male-female love relationships that aren t forced shoehorned in anymore
why are those things mutually contradictory
truetrue
@jack m  sounds like you got grifted
i like romances in games though. the old psx final fantasy s  metal gear solid  the original baldurs gate saga  dragon age etc all were lovely. however it gets ruined when it goes woke.
exactly!!!!!i asked my french film teacher  stefan  the same thing and he responded  i don t know. i don t know why hollywood feels the  need  to give the hero a  love interest   but that s just how they think.
what is wrong with a character having a love interest exactly
the real question is  why does every character nowadays have to be gay and raced swapped i feel bad for the redhead s honestly.
they want to have compelling stories  which typically means humanizing the characters as much as possible  and humans typically  fall in love  at some point. all of this at least makes sense  even though i don t agree with the idea that all games need super compelling stories  i get it  at least .what doesn t make sense is the sexuality of these characters today. unproductive  and very unpopular  despite what they re trying to convince the audience .
i feel like love interests in games have pretty much fallen apart  unless it s lesbian  soyb and musclemom  or estranged divorced parents.
@norman readdis  atreus already has angrboda this is already happened dude.
@roach  zelda and link are almost never romantically involved except for skyward sword
@hal 9000  honestly at least someone is honest
@slaine v  leon and adas thing is honestly just simp meme material now lol
@nehemiah pouncey  ellie was gay in the first game s dlc
@teo_live  the love in mgs never flourished especially solid snakes the only soulmate he had was otacon in a non gay way.
@chandller burse don t underestimate western industry when it come to pandering and virtue signaling. most comic book characters are also straight until this crap is been push for almost a decade now  bobby drake iceman and alex scott og green lantern. atreus aka loki is a slam dunk to be a bi or pansexual if they re gonna have the misconception of the nordic myth goes. also angrboda race swap alone is evident enough where they re going. even samus nowadays is being identified as trans by twitter.  you can t just make this up.
because too many games nowadays are long  interactive movies. i honestly hate this trend. been playing a lot of gamecube ps2.
@mark herman you know ps2 rpgs also are very long games. having a long game is not the issue here. honestly more content gets you money s worth. than paying full price on a bare bones game. cough avengers cough and anthem etc.
@norman readdis  the issue is not with game length  it s with the egregious amount of cut-scenes my comment about interactive movies . i don t want to play a tiny movie  i want to play a game. character development is fine and all  sometimes great  but i prefer gameplay to come first.  i generally dislike a lot of modern aaa titles for this reason. i don t need a 7 min cinematic segway  just shut up and open the damn chest.
seriously  why aloy became chunky in this game  isn t supposed she became slimmer because she s need to move around and burned those fat
@mark herman you know these cutscenes just replace the tons of dialog in old games. it s now more immersive than reading thru dialog bubble for 30-45 minutes. they re still the same. you just get to watch it nowadays than reading it. new ff games still clocks 50 hours like old ps1 does. i finish xv in 40 and took me 100  getting all the game offers and platinum. even ffx clocks 40-50 standard and 100 if you re a completionist. you re nostalgia is making you blind and bias sadly and i m a gaming collector since atari 2600. i have all of them. i know their history  pros and cons. games are fine as long as they re not made out of greed and politics. also your views are only exclusive to aaa games and devs  indies are making the games with your preference.
@norman readdis  you seem to believe i m fixated on rpg s. i m not. never even mentioned them. what i m referring to  again  is excessive story exposition aided by cut-scenes. it has bled into many other genres of game. it s not exclusive to rpg s.i too am 20yrs older than the current target demo. i too have been playing games for  30yrs. i m stating my opinion. i m not trying to win a debate. listing your  gamer credentials  and name dropping systems is pretty juvenile and has nothing to do with the current topic of discussion.excessive story expo fueled by long-ass cut-scenes isn t gameplay and i quite often find it tedious at best. that is my opinion again  i ve said nothing about rpg s .i m aware of indy devs and the games they produce. that s why i specifically mentioned aaa titles  in which said issue is particularly prevalent in.i really don t know how i can be any clearer than that. have an awesome day.
@norman readdis  loki is already an insane pansexual in the myths.they already refused to have angrboda birth the world serpent why even make him bi if they aren t gonna do the whole horse thing and all the other shit he got up to
@norman readdis  angrboda being race swapped i feel is a loose term she was never swapped since the version in gow was always black.same for hades always being grotesque and red when he never was in myth.
@norman readdis  why do any of you listen to twitter
@chandller burse  ellie is not the onlygay game charater tho.there was one in mk 10 forgot hisname.
@chandller burse  i m amazed nintendonever came out with one of theircharaters being gay.probably link
perhaps it s because of fans influencing these things
@roach  i don t know where you get the idea that the goal of zelda is to save the princess. nintendo literally did away with that trope in the 90s
@mad_amos  yeah but hogwarts you can only play once and then it s boring
@hostmann socrates  because the message
@nehemiah pouncey  ok  who cares if mk 10 had one
she isn t a love interest  she could be but it depends on what you choose.
@mark herman  pretty surre only rpgs have long cutsnces  most have again replaced reading. by watching. even half life let s you wait for expo scenes. honestly if you cannot wait for a minute long cutscene you re playing the wrong game. if you re not here for a  debate  then you shouldn t have voice your  opinions  because your  opinions  will get shut down quick. i understand you don t like  modern  games. but you don t have the entitlement to complain without proper non bias viewpoint.
@chandller burse you are contradicting yourself here.you re saying loki s misconception of insane  pansexuality  then you re trying to justify angrboda s race swapping because it s their  reinterpretation  of the myth.i love arguments like this with you lol. i always remember you.believe me when you see cory s advocacy and chris judge s virtue signaling shirts. they can sipped them in the coming games. already gone 2 main game retconned as gey. they ll not stop.ellie became gey after bruce left and kneel took over with the dlc. she stole a male pron mag in the 1st game. they ll introduce gey stuff on god of war bet you on that. uncharted already had  chlodine  going internally in neutered dog offices  probably nate s daughter will be as well.
@chandller burse because corporations like sony does. twitter is basically the news source for a company to pander to. i m sure you re aware of it  even melonie knew it.
@sagittarius476 it s called overton window. in their head cannon gey aloy is going to be a recurring lore moving forward. people should be aware of esg. you guys are always giving an inch for their mile  that s why we re in this situations nowadays. they re exploitng your  middle ground  mindset to subliminally push an idea in the forefront.
@norman readdis  ok well we don t know that yet  in horizon 3  they might even give us a choice between seyka   a male character but for now  that kiss is completely optional   people need to chill out.
@norman readdis  ellie became gay after bruce left  show me a source on that because ellie as far i ever heard was always gay and she was gay in the dlc and did bruce leave that damn soon
@norman readdis  its just not hard to ponder how much of people here are right or just literally seeing gay people and going off the rails.some of you don t even have a single good justification for why this time is always different.if ellie s dlc was about her and a boy. almost none of you would even bring it up as being bad or weird for her being a teen and all.maybe it is birthed from some dumbass agenda. maybe it isn t it s not impossible but its really sad that a creator can t do anything even if they just wanted a gay character it would be called woke today neither side lets them win anymore if they are straight and white they would be called homophobic.hell some characters are just subtly bi or gay and thats all people seem to let slide even then i don t know.
@norman readdis  chloe and nadine got together  i don t remember hearing about that.
@norman readdis  considering how weird the ancient myths are you re lucky god of war seemed to ignore the pansexual stuff this long anyways.zeus was an odd lot imagine an entire game seeing what he did to women and i don t know if he did anything to men.
@norman readdis  honestly i cannot imagine as your pfp would imply that you do hate every gay or gay implied character since kojima has had plenty of that in the metal gear franchise even big boss had weird moments especially with kaz.then there s vamp who often seems to be the personification of gay bondage for some reason.
i bet you wouldn t be complained by if  aloy had a male love interest
@gamer7916  lets be honest this video wouldn t exist if that was the case.maybe thats not important but honestly i am fairly sure its still incorrect that there are more gay relationships in media than straight ones
@chandller burse  except there isn t.  for most of the last millennia  with few exceptions  every character in every book  play  movie  and game has been straight.  aragon  romeo and juliet  king arthur and guinevere  etc.  only in the last couple of years did homosexual representation become sort of mainstream again after 1500 years of suppression by christian and islamic culture.  there s billions of straight characters across centuries of media  yet barely a handful of gay characters and the 4chan people starts throwing a tantrum.
@chandller burse honestly japanese media present this very well for decades now. it s just the western industry made it force and egregious and you can really see the big difference. monster and brokeback mountain did fine but it s still a niche market and they re not trying to  trailbalze  something like how it is nowadays. they re thinking about  thought provoking  in a bad way. kneel s brain is always about  subverting expectations . he s just too over his head think every  expectation subverted  are good.
@gamer7916  i am literally saying that
@chandller burse watch the documentary i reply to you.
@norman readdis  metal gear was always weird in how people view it.anti war  supposedly anti american anti western culture even despite how it looks. definitely anti nuke.big boss praises che guevara a communist who revolutionized cuba.this series is already full of arguments to piss around with anyways.
@norman readdis  neil druckmann is whatever but his actual games aren t awful he still wasn t the only writer and no matter what anyone says there are far far worse games than tlou2 i don t like views that say abby was correct which do exist i ve met them and its not a masterpiece neither was the first game.honestly the worst thing nd did was favor tlou so much they remade it before even looking at their older games.
@norman readdis  i mean its all perspective anyways too i ve met people who thinks kojima is actually a bad writer and people just look at him too ignorantly with the belief he is a genius.and i can t even say if thats true or not.some even say mgs5 was amazing or proves kojima was a hack.or thats death stranding whatever.
how about some great gomes that have great straight relationships  i can t seem to find a good one
@chandller burse  the gay ones tend to be the exaggerated and forced ones
@j b days gone.
ah yes  i miss does old day where video games used to have simpler stories buy used to be fun  like spyro the dragon  crash bandicoot  croc  tomb raider and many more. good times!
why does every charater need a love interest  because love is a powerful motivator. its why men built civilization. its why superman doesn t work without lois  and why every  superman goes bad  story starts with her death. the inverse is also true  its why selina kyle left bruce wayne at the altar because batman can t be batman if he s happy.
i honestly am not against love interests. to quote rumplestilkin from once upon a time   i m a fan of true love . and i m honestly not against lesbians. i m just against it when it s repeated due to stupid politics
i like romance options. old bioware games are much more replayable because of romance options
@rob everything does not need to be dc. call of duty work without a love interest. metroid  dmc  not including 4   deus ex and the list goes on. men and women is always needed yes but sometimes those are not necessary to the plot. a game without a love interests but a political one will suck. ie avengers  forespoken  etc. it really does up to script writing. even dceu plops because of bad writing. it s not about love interests.
@norman readdis  it isn t just just dc. love has been the basis for huge slice of classical literature. its a core part of the human condition  and when applied to an rpg  elevates that game. the dceu s poor writing not withstanding  superman doesn t work without lois lane. she s his tether to humanity. now  true  not every game needs to have romance options  but the titles you listed aren t exactly where one goes for quality story telling. cod s  story campaigns  are a joke  the game is a multiplayer military shooter. outside of the rpg genre  if you were to remove love as a driving force  every yakuza game would unravel.in burning shores  we re taking an entirely optional romance  where the relationship develops over the course of the entire game s events  where the overt romance doesn t occur until epilogue  where the payout is a simple kiss. its as much  political  as liara is in mass effect . . . but without the adult scene. a simple skim through various comments on melonie s video very quickly shows that nearly everyone complaining about it has not played either game or the expansion.
@rob i know but its sometimes not needed.hopeless romantic have its own time and place.
@roach  oh lord. you just answered your question. and if still you don t understand it...then there is no salvation
you cannot just have a love interest. you need an lgbtq love interest otherwise it does not count.
because if you don t explicit tell the world you support x is because you are against it and you need to all the time be screaming you support everything and everyone all the time.
@j b  a lot of straight relationships are generic and forced too hell most fandoms are full of fanfic shippers who adore that sort of thing.its all bad honestly half the time
@dark shadow  those were games that were intended as simple at the same time you also had silent hill and metal gear solid and other games with more complex storytelling there was never a  use to be  then you have to go back to like nes games.
@rob  i thought a lot of men built civilizations for power and survival.we did that for love  didn t half those old societies have the leaders who built have multiple women anyways
because muh inclusivity
@chandller burse  but silent hill and metal gear are japanese games  i was referring specifically to western games  and these were the ones that came to mind.
nothings stopping you from having fun with the game but you  what else is there to say.
@mad_amos  what the heck are you talking about! hogwarts was alot more woke than this game. did you even play hogwarts  i did  its a great game but they definitely caved in to the wokies  you d know that if you played it.
@dark shadow  who cares if western games have actual stories
@chandller burse  who do you think men acquired that power for and survived for  remove love from the equation  and men are content to chill in a sparsely furnished apartment with a folding futon.
@rob  pretty sure our species has a love for power and gaining it though so it can t be all for love
@rob  i like how your comment does imply that if men never wanted love we wouldn t be dictators  greedy or ceos.i am fairly sure thats completely incorrect
@chandller burse  what do you think men who become dictators and authoritarians do with that power
@chandller burse  don t mistake that for civilization building.
@rob  civilizations to me aren t built on love they built on safety and riches and power
no idea but the hogwarts weirdos really wanted a romance storyline....why
@hostmann socrates  man bad   husband bad .
@chandller burse  to be blunt  its not about you. its about what is.
its optional dingus
@rob  to be blunt i don t believe that is what it is.
@chandller burse  you re entitled to your opinions  not your own realities though.
@rob  all we ve both done is say things never proved them.literally i think its impossible for all civilizations to be built on love.the dang nation i live in was built for freedom of sorts not a romance. and honestly benjamin franklin would be doing it for some old woman and thomas for sally hemings.
@rob  and i am fairly certain the roman empire didn t exist because of love unless all of that sex and orgies counts
@chandller burse  well  the entire sally hemings theory was long discredited  but we could go for pages on that alone. jefferson lies covers it in detail with primary sources  if you want to read up.
why does it have to be groundbreaking. shouldn t it just be seen as normal
it s a virtue signal
@julian davis  it s not normal.
if it s normal  they can t be celebrated for doing it or feel superior for challenging society.  but i m with many of the others. her being gay doesn t bother me  especially with her actor or the trend in hollywood.  it s the fact that there s been plenty of opportunity to establish her sexuality or just leave her aromantic.
totally makes sense to appeal to the minority of the target demograpic. but gay is a trend  so i suspect more people will be gay while its trending  making the ratio much higher.
the wild thing about this is that people like you actually care.
old kpop song is better than today  everything goes downhill with kpop since 2017
@bobo boy  true  but there is still some good stuff out there  it just isn t as common. japanese music is where its at.
@mao zedong  i dunno  modern japanese take is kinda off. traditional instruments are cool though and something like maximum hormone but that an old group. also kyary pamyu pamyu but she also like 10y old artistedit  i d say asians still killing it with bgm in games
it s very noticeable when that said female character will start questioning and complaining about her love interest boyfriend while the said boyfriend was portrayed as weak  don t agree with her plan and being a baby. i even aware of the fact that they ve made every female character cheating on their bf husband in comics then makes them like it s not a big problem. but when the male character does it  it s called a violation against her loyalty. heh  double standard at it s best.
@aiveq  there are a lot of good japanese artists out there. i d be happy to give you some of my personal favorites if you re interested.
nah first girl she meets in hollywood. for sure makes so much more sense
in the start of forbidden west  avad expresses an interest in getting to know aloy as her  rather than as a standin for ersa  and one of your reply options is a soft yes
@ninja flibble  it s just unfortunate that nothing comes out of it. i think by forcing it this way through a dlc with no other options  you are actually stripping player agency away with the power of choice to make their aloy whom they want to play as. is your aloy a lesbian  great! you chose that! is your aloy straight only  great! you chose that. is she both  great! you chose that. but by forcing us all into this one romantic path for whatever reason  we re no longer players  but observers at this point. that s not the point of the gaming medium. we interact with games  we don t observe them playing themselves.
@retrochallengegamer  it does say that you can choose not to do that kiss. but we ll have to wait for the next game to see how that player choice is handled. it s a tricky thing since it means having to make the next game acknowledge which world state it should go with and it has multiple states it could start in. bioware had to create a whole new tool to help their dragon age games keep track of the world state.aloy didn t need this though  since the horizon games are largely action-based. certainly they have a story--and it s not even that bad of one--but it s not a story that requires aloy to have a canon love interest  especially when no matter which way they take her  some political group s going to complain. personally i would complain about a rushed  poorly done romance than i would a homosexual one.
this
sis it s not an optional thing
yes.
@lazy creepypasta  well optional in the sense that you can choose how the scene plays out  but aloy s feelings for the most part are fixed.
which that choice is part of what is great about the first dragon age  the mass effect series  and cyberpunk. all of them allow player agency with regards to romance  which is pretty cool.
because they want to push an agenda
yep. avad in the beginning even hints he wants aloy to be his mate and you literally have the option to reciprocate his feelings to a degree or brush him off.
this is why we have fire emblem
cause they ve seen that people mostly make straight relationships happen on their first play through when a game lets you choose these things.  first play through is usually how players want things to play out and taken more seriously. and second  is just messing around. its been talked about before wokism. while knowing that they don t like it so they take the option away. when lesbo is chosen on purpose by gamers its usually for reasons they don t like either funny enough.
@goatofdeath same with fallout 4
agreed. quite a few games actually did such approach  like dragon age  mass effect  skyrim and so forth. i do not see why guerilla games needs to turn aloy into a gay just to piss of the gamer community  especially the female gamers out there.
@gobi subramaniam  everything is gay now  if not gay then pan or bi. look no further than comics  it seems like half of all the characters are lgbtq  of some variety now. it isn t about representation  if it were then only 2  or less would be lgbtq . hell even the wolverine  once a giga-chad among giga-chads has been reduced to a simp that s part of a throuple with jean grey and cyclops.
u mean like in the golden days of gaming
yes. i misses the good old bioware style romance route and characters. why can t we have both male and female chatacter customization anymore
i wish they did it as ubisoft did in ac odyssey  but in the end i don t understand why people are losing their shit over this. if that s how they want to write aloy then so be it.
their
i hope it doesn t stay as canon for the next game. i prefer aloy a lone wolf.  cuz they did ruin it with this.
their
yes that is the perfect way to do it!
agreed. let the players choose with whom they  as aloy  ended up with. a little element of rpg there. guerilla didn t provide real romance options with previous characters. i think the problem is guerilla really guiding aloy with a fixed storyline here  even in her romance. yeah  so horizon is not an rpg  just a linear open world action game with little rpg elements.
this comment is king  the legend..
cyberpunk 2077 did this really well.
exactly. dragon age inquisition  skyrim and others did that
yep  that last sentence words it up perfectly.  what is the end game here   just having two pats chatting about neutral pc topics   can t wait!
man  the tomb raider legend trilogy was such a high point in gaming. even the older ones  as clunky as they are to play. i sure hope they don t ruin lara like they did aloy.
original lara croft was perfection
the original lara croft was kinda square..but what can you do  as were the times....lol.
this. i adored lara as a child and teen. i had big breasts too  not in a good way  in a painful way xd  and it is dumb and weird but i just always loved lara for jumping around tombs with her e cup. but ofcourse an intelligent woman can t have big breasts so they turned her into an angsty teenager.
i think she was perfect. just want to play the game  do it. want to know more about the character  read the manuals. they actually had to develope stuff like birthday after they released the game since it was a new phenomenon of the fans wanting to actually know the character to the detail.
btw lara was intended to be a lesbian
@raven  no  she historically and objectively was not.
@aridonas  she historically and objectively was but you can deny canon all you want if that makes you feel better about your miserable excuse of a life
@raven  if i had a coconut for every time some lunatic said something like that.
@raven  your deleted response clearly illustrates how laughably ill equipped you are to handle discussion proper. i wouldn t worry  though. we re not in the same class.
@raven  pathetic defines you.
@thebadwolf  y all are the one denying canon bc it upsets you
@aridonas  i didn t delete my response but if you want to think that go ahead. you re just making stuff up now because you know you re wrong and you ve lost   lara is still a lesbian
@raven   the only one upset here is quite visibly you. next time you are emotionally triggered into starting an argument with people  at least do some research and come prepared with objective facts so the discussion is somewhat interesting. simply stating your imaginary sexualized thoughts does not make it reality. there are over two entire decades worth of mediums exploring her original character that easily and swiftly disprove your notion. similar to how the quotes from her flew right over your head. understandable  however  as that would require you to actually know the subject material in full before throwing baseless claims around. your ignorance amuses me.
yea but on the other side of the coin  iv read critics saying that lara is entirely  fictional just like all game and movie characters...but if they read what and who they are based on its not if they are totally made up from scratch...
you have never heard of you haul  2 girls move much faster than guys. i m surprised they didn t move in together already
it s 1 thing to have a protag get with a character against the players wish. it s another to do it in a game where they can make choices
idk whats so great about this game anyway iv only watched 30min of the play-through and it was so boring and generic i switched channels...
because she doesn t like men it seems. which is okay.....right
@julian davis  she litterally got jealous of varl and zo kissing   obviously she likes guys
@lok1trickster  the devs forgot about that cus reasons  humm i mean the message.
@julian davis  not in the story setting they devised  because now like tlou2  the only message they can push is a nihilistic one.
@lok1trickster  there was a lot of ways to interpret that scene. jealousy wasn t the vibe i got. just it was a part of her that wondered what her life would be like if that happened to her  but she shrugged it off because of her mission.
@julian davis  if her template didn t either  yeah. you re born gay... right
@m s  her template
@julian davis  what is aloy revealed to be in the first game
not surprised that she is not interested in men. the person she is a clone of was a lesbian.
do they actually give you a option to not have this as alloys romantic relationship
i played it for the mechs and combat  nearly every dialogue scene gets skipped  unless it has sylens in it  man that dude could hold attention  damned shame hes dead ffs. watching aloy and the rest of the fempocalyse waft queef tier dialogue all over the screen gives me stomach cramps
@matsimurf _  sylens was literally the best character and delivered the best dialogues in that entire dlc. rest in peace to lance reddickunless they can find someone else equally good at the role  the horizon series looks to be heading in a very bad direction. what with the uglified aloy and now the modern writing cliche wokenessalso  that asian woman character was so uninteresting and bland that i simply could never be bothered to learn her name. throughout the story i was never invested in her. so that s why i just call her  that asian woman
just swap out the characters name for any of a dozen others and you ve got the plot for so many woke shows these days
they could ve at least tried to make seyka feel less like  quen-aloy   which is the main thing i call her. because she seems like she s exactly the same character as aloy just from the quen tribe. i haven t finished burning shores  but i haven t seen a lot of character traits to really differentiate her from aloy to feel like a different character
and that asian woman
@nothing nothing   you can either accept the relationship  say your not ready for any kind of relationship due to responsibility and also sayek is more of a friend  or say you don t want to date her cause you think of her as a friend   both involve respecting sayek and saying she s an inspiration   sayek is more understanding if you choose the brain option rather than the fist option
it feels like dreamworks makes fun exactly of that with their version of ariel. she s an antagonist.
the morally grey character trope is finally losing steam in popular culture  but not by much considering so many people now are narcissistic and can t identify with heroes.
that s because they don t have motivations anymore  they have egos. and writers probably have hard time distinguishing between those two.
batman becoming a hero is always consistently the obsession with his parents death which i will admit at this point in his late career is damn awful sometimes since he still hasn t coped with it. one comic in the 70s said he did but well the writers went back on that statement.
it s no longer about making profits  it s about checking the woke boxes
@bobo boy  the reason wokeness is so apparent is because companies see profit in it so you re wrong.people act as if greed and consumerism isn t part of why this occurs lol.
deku is a tumor on this trope. pick a better one.
@just some guy with epic grasses  can you explain your position  is there a reason why you think that deku doesn t conform to the archetype  or are you just annoyed by him
zero dawn has been my favorite game of all time  but i m not a huge gamer.  that being said  it was the story that brought me in.  it engaged my imagination and brought me out of the real world.   but with this  shoehorning and signaling  not even the gay aspect  i can tell it would take me out of that world.  i haven t played it yet  but this move doesn t surprise me with what i hear about games and movies these days.  it s the forcing of a plotline that breaks it more than anything.
i agree with those wholeheartedly!! erend was such a cool guy  i had very high hopes that if aloy ever did decide to settle down and find a partner  she d choose him. it made perfect sense.
guess we know why it s forbiddin now
so fucking what aloy has always liked women she s been bi from the start.
@snorri sveinn orrason  and she ll never be able to procreate with a woman either  so humanity is doomed.
@snorri sveinn orrason  other than the end of forbidden west where it was revealed that elisabet was gay name me one instance in either game where it hints that aloy is into women. i ll wait
woke like most at guerrilla  well shit  that s a shame to hear that the same developers of killzone or all games  are woke. i wanted them to make another killzone installment but now i get a really bad damn feeling that they re gonna ruin it with breadtube levels of beating the progressive liberal message over the head with  good guys vs space nazis . what was great about the previous games was that the factions were very nuanced and the in-universe political sphere conflict was a very complex and sophisticated one. but now  if they made a new one i doubt we d get a very nuanced narrative of the lore.  hell i don t even think we d even get to play as the helghast in a campaign nor would guerrilla would want us to sympathize with them.
you said exactly what i was thinking.
tell me you don t like the fact that aloy isn t straight without telling me you don t like the fact aloy isn t straight.
well there s plenty of backstory and explanation for aloy s motivations and abilities.
@stephen fitzgerald  he s just a very poorly written character. he s the perfect example of this trope done badly.
@just some guy with epic grasses  i will agree that he s certainly not the best example of the trope. others have done it better and he s easily overshadowed by other mcs just within the shonen sub-genre.still  if we re comparing him to carol danvers or rey palpatine  i think we can both agree that he s still a much better example of the trope  which is to say  he doesn t come off as a narcissistic glory-hog.
agreed. the motivation comes from a passion for doing the right thing  even when it s hard or it hurts. current  heroes  often fall under the trope of just being assertive and rude. actual heroes are selfless  and put others first.
@defeatereater  too true
@stephen fitzgerald  that s for sure.
@chandllerburse737 nope  there s a reason go woke go broke is a saying. everyone hates it.
the compelling motivation for becoming a hero is to protect other people did you intend to apply that to aloy  her entire motivation through hfw is to protect the world and the people in it. the defining component of her personal arc in hfw is that she can t do it alone  she needs friends  allies . . . a tribe as rost said in the first game. its a lesson she nearly had to die to learn.
they write heroes the way you re suppose to write villains. makes you think about the kind of people writing stories these days.
my favorite hero was jack burton from big trouble in little china. he just wanted to get his truck backok  he wasn t actually the hero of the story. he was more of the audience stand in and comic relief. but still..
@devine interventions  jack burton was a literal meme among my college roommates and i. every time sh t hit the fan  someone would come up with a   y know what ol  jack burton says at a time like this  we loved that movie so much
go look up aloy in fortnite  they kept her original appearance instead of that abomination the devs made her in the horizon game.
so who cares my friends that are girls was there for me in i m gay
not even the option to date who you want sucks.
not to mention avad.
the horizon series is a generic third person action game with pretensions of being an rpg. change my mind
@brian sanders  this! you took the words out of my mouth. it seemed like they were hinting at those two together.  now the flirting and blushing means nothing.
@hostmann socrates  you re right  horizon feels like a generic ubisoft game
ehhhhh he s kinda rough around the edges and not very good looking. the most viable offer she had was from that new sun-king from the first game  he seemed straight up in love with her and was actively turning down other people for her and he got totally ignored lol
@camila costa  legit horizon sucks honestly the first one was ok i even platinum d it but after watching a couple of hours of 2 it felt like the same game and seriously got old even playing the trial was annoying but her character  what little she had  was completely trashed in 2 she had developed a personality at the end of 1 but in 2 she completely regressed back to being an @   for no reason at first it was due to her alienation but in 2 everyone loved her yet she treated them like trash not to mention she treated them like that after they risked their lives for her
@victor von doom  that s how it goes. they bait fans with a decent character  grab their money from the sequel that people buy because of the good time they had with the original  and they laugh at us all the way to the bank.i m personally not buying any new games until i know for sure if it has any sort of sociopolitical message in it or not.i m actually going back in time and buying older games  for a steal usually  and having a blast. there are so many good games that i never knew about over the years  before the woke times.10 10 recommend games like stronghold crusader  medieval 2 total war  etc. kingdom come  deliverance is a good one that s also pretty new  so i guess all the newer titles aren t so trashy lol.
@connor baz  i m about to pull a melonie i recommend og tomb raider everything else i love you can play on ps4 and 5 except uncharted 3 multiplayer which was my favorite because they gutted it for golf simulator departments sadly
@hostmann socrates  i thought it was a visual novel with light combat
@ew gaming  as a woman too...looks may be important..but what is more important. in a dangerous world  a man that risks his life for me and can help me survive and be happy  matters more than sex or looks.plus having kids is important. have sex with who you want. but it is extremely selfish in a post apocalyptic world to eat food  do no work  and refuse to ever have kids. idk.
@connor baz  yeah you can find a lot of really good  older games cheap.i bought x-com 2 with all dlc for  5.99 a while back and it s amazing. still haven t beaten it  it s a pretty tough game.i bought kingdom come a while back but haven t really played it yet. i got a lot of games i haven t played yet  there s almost 90 games on my ps5.i m just finishing up sackboy a big adventure. didn t expect much from it but it turned out to be the most fun 3d platformer i ve ever played  and i got it free with ps .then i have hundreds of games on my phone for snes  genesis  gba  ds  psp  ps1  and n64 that i play on my phone with emulators and a ps4 controller. even got this really nice mount for my phone that wraps around the ps4 controller  combining my controller and phone into an amazing gaming device.that s how i found my favorite rpg series  trails in the sky. i spent hundreds of hours on my phone playing the trails series on psp. loved them so much i bought all 4 trails of cold steel games for ps4. and there s a new trails game releasing very soon.thankfully there are so many older  amazing games  because the entire industry is turning to complete garbage really soon.
@hostmann socrates  i mean  the first one was pretty awesome! i don t usually have the time to get invested in these huge  open world games  but i was into that for several months when i was able to play. it has a great setting and gameplay mechanics.
@jack m  xcom 2 is even better with mods too!
sony just went full ubisoft and you never go full ubisoft.
@gigachad guts  i d argue sony went full sony  ubisoft is another beast.
@hostmann socrates  the sales  figure of the franchise would prove otherwise.......
they made him a bumbling simp clown in hfw. they really did him dirty
@random reactions tv  we re not talking about you  fruity guy.this is about aloy  whom in hzd showed to lean towards being straight.
it simple just stop buy these game it s our choice to accept it by buying it.
@r.e. gato  it s like they neutered him  guy was the osseram military commander in zero dawn  loyal to the new king.osseram and carja were interesting tribes too  that acted more like ancient rome and greece compared to the others.
@camila costa  anything but lol horizon can beat any ubisoft game tenfold before having breakfast
errand is like fin...
they made erend into a complete git. another dude sacrificed for herman hulsts need to rub up against neil druckmann.
@anti-toxic communities          she showed a lot of things  but full straight behavior certainly wasn t part of it  you should replay it. she turns down avad nearly in disgust but when petra flirts with her she act very differently. at best she s bisexual   when she mentions that varl is interesting which is a stretch  but when a character is straight  typically he or she have a clear pretender in the game and aloy certainly didn t have that in the first game. she could have been gay  straight or bi it s a matter of opinion because there was no clear in your face indications  it was always on the mystery side for a reason. when it s not in your face that she s straight in the first game you know she s gonna be gay in the second.
@bruno  she was straight. when the first game came out  these delusions we have over here in the west weren t even on people s radars  and homosexuals were still shunned.so obviously she was created without the gay agenda being a thing.
@anti-toxic communities          this is based on your opinions not facts. it was never stated anywhere in game she was straight. as a matter of fact  it was specifically not mentioned so the door would be open to it in a sequel. if she was bound to be straight she would ve had a clear pretender and she did not.
@bruno  it s your opinion just the same.
lol if that s such a big problem for you get therapy
goodness. make games unique again!!! we re getting the same thing every time !
second comment  aloy actually doesn t have a  hero s complex.  what the case actually is  is that she has to do what must be done. furthermore  the story was set up to have her be the only one who could do it  given that her genetic connection to elisabet sobeck  her ancestral  mother   who was the head of  zero dawn.  that s the way this is set up -- and perhaps ironically  beta  the other elisabet clone  showed the other side of elisabet s personality  her uncertainty. her despair. her sense of hopelessness. and  something i know well  the sense of cynicism that comes with being very highly intelligent. beta and aloy are two sides of the same coin -- yet aloy does everything to convince beta to fight  something beta never had while  growing up  on odysseus. it is a fascinating look into how  exactly  our environments vs our experiences both play into  and play against each other  to make us who we are -- and at the same time  giving us the ability to reconcile both sides of that coin into the person who we could have been  versus who we are.
they just couldn t resist turnin aloy into an alphabet person
from what i just saw of the scene  it seems that it is an option but not a canon choice. like you can reject her. what they could be doing is hinting that there will be romance options in the next game. depending on your choices of dialogue in last game  aloy definetely shows interest in male characters too. so that would make her bisexual. i mean for example with avad she says in one of the choices  i do want to see meridian again  avad...and you  while blushing and says it in a soft tone. they didn t really add in flirting options with the girl characters last game  so they might have done this to show that aloy is bi  so that next game comes around  aloy having both female and male romance options won t come as a shock to ppl. the romance choice would work even though it s 3 games in  as other games have done it before. not sure if yall know tell tales the walking dead  but in the 4th game they implemented a romance system in which you had both female option and male option  or you could just choose to befriend one of them if you didn t want a romance
saying woke people are popular is like saying lizzo is anorexic
the part where a woman can t be strong and independent if she s in a relationship with a man is what gets me.it would be super wholesome if they added a male love interest as a co op character who helps you through the game  those are also very in fashion right now with western devs.but it had to be a shallow  cringe and unbelievable lesbian romance...
about aloy s abs or lack thereof  i can t believe i m really about to seriously discuss a fictional character s 3d-rendered abdominal muscles but here we go lol  - if i recall  aloy didn t actually have abs in zero dawn until the release of the frozen wilds dlc. before that point  the carja blazon was  i think  the only armor set that showed her midriff and her un-jacked abdomen was much the same as it is now in forbidden west. in the frozen wilds  some of the  new  armor sets we got in that dlc were actually just the outfits of already existing characters ported to be wearable by aloy  except that  for reasons i m going to assume were due to a tight production schedule  the way guerilla games did this was to simply copy-paste the geometry of those other character models onto aloy s frame. as a result  frozen wilds   new  nora stealth armor was just war chief sona s outfit and character model with aloy s head and skin color. likewise  the light blue carja armor in that pic you showed of aloy s different abs is actually just talanah khan-padish s character model and armor set from the neck down  and therefore the missing abs in question belong to talanah and never were aloy s. they did still nerf aloy s face itself  though in-game it s definitely less noticable than it was in that first gameplay reveal trailer.about the story choices - i will say that after playing through forbidden west  i think it s inaccurate to say that aloy has a hero savior complex  more that she is convinced that whatever she must do to save the world  she must do it alone because she s the only one uniquely equipped to do so. her arc  if it can be called one  is coming to realize how misguided that notion is as she forms a sort of team of sidekicks to help her  made of new and returning characters. some of these characters i enjoyed and others came across as weakly written to me. i can appreciate the attempt  but i still think aloy as a protagonist is just a bit too mary sue-ish even after this development. as some others have pointed out  the writing of aloy and the overall story is probably the weakest aspect of an otherwise awesome game packed to bursting with super fun combat  engaging open-world exploration  and incredible visual style.i believe the main story of the burning shores dlc makes this problem worse  as the ultimate hero aloy teams up with seyka - who in backstory and personality ends up being kind of just another aloy but from the quen tribe this time - to take down the antagonist. despite how fun the game world is to look at and interact with and explore  especially in the new explorable area  the story of burning shores left me with the unpleasant taste of a boring and shockingly predictable story of one or more personally unrealistic badass girlbosses sticking it to a comically unsubtle  over-exaggerated  strikingly flat and one-dimensional male bad guy before admitting they ve got the hots for each other. in this case  the only real defining traits of the bad guy in question are his psychopathic lack of empathy and his vast god complex  to the point of his evil plan involving brainwashing a bunch of tribespeople into believing that he is a literal deity just to satisfy his ego. like... really  that s the best they could come up with  as much as i love the horizon games from a gameplay and style perspective  i ve never thought aloy was particularly well-written  and i m disappointed that it doesn t look like that s going to change any time soon.
we already had a strong lesbian heroine with sobek  the cool thing about aloy was she seemed above all this  or rather   not able to make human connections as she was mostly an outcast. the only real relationship she had was with her father figure frost. but they even kind of downplay that by making it seem like she connects more with sobek. she does mention that the reason she is grounded is because of frost which is a theme they should have explored more. most people could connect with aloy better as she was all about values and achieving a goal  almost to a fault  it made her more interesting to more people as we would witness her somewhat awkward interactions with many other people. it was the reason i could understand her coldness to errand  not because she was gay or didn t appreciate him  she just wasn t good with people. so they established that very early on. but another strong female comes along and aloy suddenly falls for her in the shortest time possible   it s obviously some kind of woke pr stunt. heck there s even better female prospects that she would have gone for if this is the route they wanted. the tenakth had plenty of strong women  not to mention petra  who obviously liked aloy. this is the problem with all this woke shit  it s forced and it almost always invalidates existing relationship dynamics for the sake of inclusivity. my hope was that seyka would be a character that manages to connect with aloy and allow her to have a more meaningful friendship as seyka would be a woman that made aloy feel as distant as she made others feel  just turning it into a romantic one seems shallow and a waste of what would have been a good narrative. seyka should have been the character that made aloy rethink how she treats people close to her. still they just burst the bubble on what made aloy cool  her unique flaw of not being too good with casual or social human interaction.
in the second game it seemed like everyone wanted to get with alloy  male or female. which is kind of understandable since her name and deeds were known to the people  the first celebrity of this new world really. so it made sense. i didn t pursue any advances as  like melonie  i wanted to focus on the adventure.i remember some woman asking me to meet her at the bar in the very beginning of the game. i never went to talk with her  she still sitting there waiting for alloy in my save file lol.
one of the devs even said when asked why aloy isn t beautiful. it went like   if we did that  it would be harmful.  like really.
i would be more surprised to find a female mc who isn t gay at this point.
my first thought was  shit  avad is not gonna be happy  i swear  everytime nil had some conversations with aloy that sounded flirty  i was like  alright  i might like that idea . than avad started to be flirty too but in more shy way and honestly  i liked the idea that they might become a thing. and now...come on  you gave me signs of potential love interest in two games. if they want to bring some romantic relationship  at least give me a choice whitch one. or none.
can i just play a game that doesn t have my favorite characters  finding their true selves  for a friggin minute  like please  how is this character development!
melonie for some reason i always feel better after i watch one of your videos.
well  i remember when avad was kind of like hinting at pursuing something with aloy early in forbidden west  when he gifts her the tiara and it seems like she was interested too and they gave you three options in the conversation as well so i thought that was gonna be something for the future...and then they do this. so we have elisabet and tilda  alva and her possible girlfriend...seems like no woman girl can t ever be with a guy here
everything you said is so damn true  i cringed so hard when they had screen time together and passed on that dreadful awkward kiss. i said in post on another vid that she had more chemistry with nix and avad. and in forbidden west she even seems jealous with varl  then they through this into a dlc.
aloy and ellie are both young female  both have red hair  both have a deceased adopted father figure   both use bows  both been made more masculine ugly less feminine by the second game  both have to make it in a post apocalyptic world   both is the only female character that can save the world  both find out their love and sexuality in a d.l.c with a new character  like what the f.
i like the gameplay and scenery in the first horizon zero dawn  i like the premise and combat.  although i lost it on the expansion when the blue light computer thing said the world was destroyed due to climate change  pretty sure it was the robots.  aloy wasn t shooting arrows and laying trip mines at rising temperatures and dodging the increasing sea level.  it was so hokey and shoehorned i had to laugh.
i never really thought aloy was attracted to anyone in the first game. she was an outcast and hated by everyone because of that  romance wasn t even anything in the game.
i always liked to pretend aloy was saving herself for me  but now that dreams over
they tried to lay the groundwork for it in fw by outing sobek as a lesbian  unknown if bi but given the closest thing she had to a decent relationship of any kind with a man that we saw was her interactions with...skater dude who wrote hades  forget his name...i doubt it . so obv aloy should be lesbian too because she s a clone of sobek.thing is  that  gay gene  still isn t an actual thing that s been scientifically verified  not that we d expect the crowd celebrating this to acknowledge that . fact is  aloy grew up knowing nothing but contempt and scorn from every woman in her life except teersa  and only knew love from rost a man. from a behavioral science standpoint  she should be as straight as a 2x4.
if you havent played the dlc then you are missing plenty of context. whether it is optional or not there is a ton of dialogue and interaction between aloy and seyka that clearly shows what their intentions are moving forward.
factual damage
especially when tucker carlson and joe rogan are the top two most popular channels people watch.  and yeah i know fox recently fired tucker  but holy shit are they going to regret that one.
@sik3xploit  that was news to me they fr fired him why
that s why lizzo got the star wars gig because they re pandered to.
lol i m glad you caught that
@est_@98  structural damage.
@victor von doom  probably because they were told to take the loss by the same powerful people who won t let bud light grab the rope and get pulled out of the quicksand. corporations don t make terrible decisions without somebody putting pressure on them. my guess  somebody like blackrock
ha!
dammit  i just washed this shirt  now it s covered in my coffee
best thing i ve read today. well done!
why are you fixated on lizzo
we are popular. wake up and accept reality.
@norman readdis  lizzo the hutt
@matthew mosier  good point.  someone murdoch answers to gave that ultimatum.  it just cracks me up how both don lemon and tucker were fired on the same day.
stong and independent is a myth and the biggest cliche ever
well that was a hint of things to come.
so then it wasn t some crazy leap in logic then....seems like people are mad just cause there s a gay person in their video game
@julian davis  i think it s less tat there is a lgbt pairing  and more that there are no options for those who either want no love interest  or straight options in addition to any lgbt options.
me too  it s so bad now  that anytime i even see a female mc i automatically just assume they re gay
so who cares i love the game in i m a keep playing the game
@random reactions tv  congrats you missed the point
there s actually a trans character in forbidden west.
@random reactions tv  clearly you care if you re replying to it just to argue that you like it. nobody cares if you re enjoying it. it has no relevance to any of the points being made.
bingo
also if they didn t look like a 16 year old boy.
@random reactions tv as a straight woman  i m not playing the game anymore. i don t support this at all
@scormern that totally could never exist in that world.
no joke.
@j jones  a lot of people who never played the game before saying they wanna play the game now  gay bi in straight
next one is lara croft  just wait
@random reactions tv  a simple test group would show that average people watch stories about romance they can relate to. it has been a part of entertainment for years and years. making a mc lesbian shrinks her marketability. making her uglier shrinks it way more. the game will suffer from this choice.
@camila costa  ok so the franchise it self ant gone change
long live bastila.
@matthew mosier  i don t think she s ugly lol in who cares if she likes girls it s not a big deal damn talking to you homophobes is like talking to a brick wall tbh
@seth rios  long live who gives a rats ass lol
@random reactions tv  whatever. guess i m just a big kotor fan. we all have our things. i m just saying though that there are some characters that cannot be tampered with from the past  short of full on retcons.
@seth rios  dude she have never been shown to be straight before so what s the big deal lol
@random reactions tv  you re talking about aloy  well because this is obviously forced  it s obviously done in a underhanded manner where most people have already bought the game and they re two games invested into the franchise by now  so they put this in a dlc and they figure people will just accept it at this point. and now there s talk of lara croft being lesbian.. like all these women are statistically going to be lesbian when the overwhelming majority of women are not. this is modern day  hardcore feminist agenda at work  plain and simple.
bayonetta isn t gay
valkyrie profile
@zero todona  technically nessa is a trans allegory  guerrilla games couldn t put the standard trans in without breaking the lore. she used to be carja but  transitioned  to tenakth  taking the name ritakka and saying that  the carja nessa was here. i killed her myself . nessa is part of a side quest that involves a man named amadis  who is looking for her because he wanted closer after 5 years of believing his love to be dead. talanah is helping him and there was a spark of romance between the two  until the end of the quest that is. it s kinda of a long story  but one thing that pissed me off was how nessa treated amadis after he found her  the tone of her voice was one of annoyance. him being there seemed to bother her  he wanted closer but she dropped him like dead weight years ago and there was no compassion or empathy in her voice. she didn t even smile. i expected a friendly greeting  something more positive with a smile  like  hi  i m glad to see you doing well  instead what i got was an annoyed monotoned  oh  it s you  why are you even here   he was understandably upset and talanah made things worse by being upset that upon finding her alive  his feelings for nessa were still slightly there. talanah then basically abandoned him saying he has to sort things out himself and  she ll be no ones second choice  and then just walks away. my mother told me if you truly love someone  you ll stay with them and support them in their struggles  talanah clearly does not love him and nessa did not truly love him  if she did  she would at least let him know that she was alive and he would have her joined her in her new life.
i am almost certain there are more that are not gay or even bi than they are.like seriously.
@camila costa  they already confirmed it with the casting call and the leaked script. she apparently hooks up with an  older  woman.
@random reactions tv  sure you are here trolls because you don t understand sooo  i don t think you got point about it
@scormern aka another trans pos being horrible to their loved one and abandoning them to find themselves.  eye roll
would be even more surprising if they re just damn great friends-
@random reactions tv   who cares  evidently  you do.
@scormern  i noticed aswell  same person who voiced sirona ryan in hogwarts legacy
@zero todona  ma am  this ain t an airport  you don t have to announce your own departure
@zero todona  why you even buy it then  you wasted 60 bucks over this now
@random reactions tv            heterophobic brick wall
it s called the male gaze
@seth rios  i like how people talk about this as if its so damn offensive to fans who invested themselves in these generic games anyways lol
@seth rios  your comment doesn t even explain the issue here well you are basically just saying that fans should totally be offended because the character that was never confirmed either sexuality is confirmed in a later entry i get it today s media is stupid but good lord this is why i don t like either sides anymore creators couldn t even just make a gay character without someone yelling at them same if it was a straight white male.clive barker be damned for being a gay man who had gay characters in his stories if he wrote them today lol.
amicia de rune and senua
@matthew mosier  ok  and whats wrong with there being some gay romances for gay people to relate to  also if you are using the relate to argument doesn t that mean representation is indeed important nothing here makes sense anymore neither side does honestly lol
@chandller burse  there are more gay romances in entertainment than there are gay people in the population. over-representation is a constant for  persecuted minorities   black representation in commercials and film is at about 500  of their population ratio at this point  it s time to make entertainment for everyday people.
@random reactions tv  it s an insult to straight women
@matthew mosier  thats probably still not a high number and also everyday people includes gay people i would think why is normal here always  straight  there is no damn normal there never was we are all freaks in some way even being super conservative is freaky in its way most would probably say.i don t get it and there are still plenty and have always been plenty of straight characters turning characters gay is bad i get but just making gay characters i don t get the issue anymore
@matthew mosier  everyday people includes every race
@j b  lol no it s not it s just two people kissing if you have a problem with it don t play it period point blank
@j b  lesbian women existing insults straight women  thats very insulting to actual straight women who aren t insecure lol
@chandller burse  yep. and we ve got 5 times as many aa s in stuff as other races. time to even it out. other races need representation  too.
@chandller burse  no  these kind of forced gay relationships are. portraying that female mcs must have a forced lesbian companion is an insult
@matthew mosier  facts. instead of focusing on the lgbtq community  maybe show some love to other races and people with disabilities. that s a bigger population that s not being represented well
@chandller burse  if they wanted to highlight aloy s sexuality  specifically that she s into women  then why wasn t this presented in the first game  heck  i ll do you one better. why didn t this romance unfold properly in the main game of fw  i ll tell you. they were afraid of negative backlash. so they shoehorned this half-baked relationship into dlc instead after people had already invested their time and money so they could play it safe and still push the agenda. now that so many are committed  well they ll have to purchase the third game just to see the conclusion  right  tricks of the trade. it was made pretty clear in zero dawn that aloy was possibly open to bisexuality  but no relationship ever materialized because she was so involved with her adventures and quest for answers it became tertiary and irrelevant. like lara croft or emily kaldwin  it is left ambiguous and it makes sense because of what aloy is. i mean do you not think it strange that if this was an  optional  romance that there would have been another optional romance with a male to give us a balanced choice  but there isn t. even with aloy s response wheel  the only option that comes close to rejecting seyka is along the lines of  this is all too much for me right now.  there s nothing for the player to say  uhh i m actually not into same-sex  sorryy.    in other words  the idea that it s optional is illusory. aloy is a lesbian now  and it s forced in the most lazy and underhanded way possible just to score woke points with minority groups. this isn t writing  it s just identity politics.             why people should steer clear of this game  not because a character is gay  but because they re constantly                characters to be gay all the time even when it doesn t jive with script. no one should support this garbage.
@seth rios  people could also just not buy the damn dlc.honestly all i ve heard of these games is that they are pretty and generic and released right before a much more massive game  breath of the wild and elden ring
@seth rios  yeah but how many here are actually in that belief  some people straight up would not say a thing about aloy or ellie even when they do the whole  why does every one need a romance   if they just were only with men
@seth rios  is this game even an rpg or choice based anyways  to me it always seemed like a basic post apocalyptic action adventure i wouldn t expect much agency and i never got why people do the same thing for people who say if tlou2 just had a choice to kill abby they like it more  who knows if thats even true
@chandller burse  because these are high budgeted games meant for a large number of people.it s like... if you make a 20 million dollar movie that centers around gay characters or whatever...  it probably isn t that high of a risk.but  if you make a 200 million dollar movie is supposed to be a family friendly movie and throw gay stuff in there you might have some  backlash and risk losing money.most people are straight and so gay relationships are not going to appeal to them.
@plainview1981  still doesn t make why straight people give such a crap about gay characters these times any less weird or even dumb
@j b  i really doubt most straight women who play these games even care
@j b  fairly certain race representation is something people here also argue when forced into stuff for the sake of it
what about...............ummm...how about..........i ll get back to you
@chandller burse  most people watch films and play games to be entertained. i guess they don t find these things entertaining or whatever.myself  i think there is a heavy handed effort to try and force people to accept or cheer lead this stuff. the more heavy handed the film and game makers get   the louder the people who disagree with it will get.i don t know how heavy handed it may or may not be in this game. i own it  but haven t played it. so  i m kind of speaking in general here.
@plainview1981  entertainment has spoken messages for centuries though this is just forced nonsense
how many damn games have this  i haven t played one recently that has unless atreus counts but that makes sense since he is trying to find out what he is meant to do for ragnarok.
sorry for the spoilers  should ve put the alert
both got uglified in the second instalment
damn common playstation heroine l master chief and marcus fenix are being fucked by their developers too x.x
outside of the gaming world  there s the 100  who did the same thing with clarke  the female mc  and her flings with chicks in a post apocalyptic world  but then every character on that show was either bi or gay so....
@fear_the_nog  lmao thank god i never bothered to watch that show. what a load of bs.
it s not the gayness that bothers me the most is how much it doesn t make any dam sense you want me to believe that aloy having been through life and death with some many people in the two games suddenly falls for this random chick in like what 2-3 days
@defeatereater  tbf  the show is quite good. they don t really focus on the romance stuff. it was more like  we re in the middle of a battle and hundreds are dying  oh  uh  let s throw in a shot of a couple girls kissing randomly. except clarke  she needs to have a good lesbo arc.
both also had their father figures killed  because  down with the patriarchy!
@gastndorf  you thought ellie was ugly  she looks fairly ordinary  but her real issue is that she s immensely sour and unlikable in tlou2.
@shawn m  i dunno if that s fair to rost. the man went down fighting saving his adopted daughter. joel got caught with his pants down because the writers gave him the idiot ball. there s a world of difference between the 2 deaths.
i immediately thought of ellie when this news came out. i wonder will we get a abby copycat in horizon 3.
@fear_the_nog  clarke i actually thought it made a lot of sense in a way as a trauma response. she killed her first love. so by only hooking up with women after that she could create a distance and never actually have to get truly close again. staying freer of romantic entanglements also allowed her to make hard choices as the leader. even her relationship with lexa really felt like lexa cared more for clarke than clarke did for her.
watch out next kratos will be gay. seems like playstation exclusives are getting infected with the big ghey.
people say sony has great stories. people don t see how creatively bunk they are  especially with these similarities.
@kantrel 7  i don t blame sony i blame gurella games that saw the last of us and let s make that but modify it a bit
@cold zero the wise  sony owns them  there are company mandates for esg scoring. sony passes it down  their developers are on-board or have no choice but to implement.
i ve always hated the fact ellie was made  happy . i never liked that decision and it made me lose all interest in playing the game. i was always surprised by the fact no one else but me seemed to not like the choice. but it felt like pandering even to me then and it rubbed me wrong. she also seemed pretty young to have a love interest and i was the same age ellie was in the game when the first one came out and i remember thinking she was way to young for a romantic subplot. no one s ever shared my feelings on this tho. even people who hate woke stuff never cared about ellie.
@goatofdeath  honestly i liked finn and clarke more than i liked lexa and clarke  though i was a big fan of lexa as a character by herself  way more than i liked clarke. actually i liked every character more than i liked clarke  from octavia to monty. clarke has been inconsistent and it s like they were just told  this is protagonist  she be do all the big stuffs and is gon be very protag and shiz
@azaybae  well they killed master chief off because halo was a disaster not saying master chief is dead i m just saying halo is dead
@hal 9000  i think people did call out the fact ellie was just a kid in that dlc and made no sense to have it centered around romantic feelings. at least i recall it and made comments myself. it made no sense why they would focus on that at her age  just came off creepy.
i mean ellie was always intended as gay as far as the devs said
@gastndorf ellie just grew up.
@xavier gage the spartans were pretty  nasty with boys to be fair.kratos probably regrets that.
@hal 9000 you do know 14 year olds date and find puppy love at least like she s not that young hell dude 12 year olds were dating for whatever reason when i was that age.
@kantrel 7 why is a kid having romance creepy  didn t the 80s use to have many movies with teens dating being involved oh i guess since they were usually played by adults it makes no harm lol.i don t get people i don t get people here or woke people there.none of ya ll make sense
@chandller burse  i think you re trying too hard to be different.  ellie  had to have been a preteen  small as she was.  and a dlc was made to specifically point out she was a look lesbian  it wasn t a film with it was subtextual. you re coming off more than the wrong way...
@chandller burse  no one could have guessed that until the dlc  considering the scene of her with a playgirl magazine.
@cold zero the wise  it is when they re in a post-apoc situation where humanity is at the brink  and the person with the best genes in that scenario decides they want to be a genetic dead end.
@xavier gage  you guys are so dramatic...
@robthedoodler  i think the idea is when they tell the story it s like hmmm  let s kill the super likeable male characters off and leave u with no choice but an angry  bitter  masculine and lesbian heroine..like all the men are too weak to survive cuz they aren t the unstoppable masculine female lesbian warrior..just similar story trajectories replaying itself
@kantrel 7  the scene with her and the magazine is actually used to say she is gay since she just laughs at it. she isn t flustered or attracted to the men in it.
@kantrel 7  ellie is literally 14 in the games i don t know what you mean by preteen she may have been 13 in the dlc but she wasn t 12.and teenagers aren t adult looking dudes like in movies
@kantrel 7  the dlc was to show what happened to her and her friend and also detail what occurred when joel was injured.you ignore all other parts to simply look at  gay  and nothing else.
@billy was here  honestly why do people even bring this up in a post apocalyptic world does anyone really want their entire life be dedicated to being a breeding cow
@timmy1tap  i really feel like after playing part 2 this wasn t what the game was attempting to say.and honestly it had worse issues than killing joel. killing joel was almost expected anyways at that point.
@chandller burse that s how life is though. humanity must continue. men have a place and so do women.
@zero todona  humanity will continue by instinct though.its so odd that people legit think gay people existing which as far i know is already a super low statistic more than the media says is like detrimental to humanity s species continuing to live and not to mention destroy themselves anyways lol.
@zero todona  honestly children would just be a burden in a world like this anyways unless you are in a successful safe zone.
@chandller burse  that s exactly what the colonies were like in the 16th and 17th century in america.
@billy was here  ah yes child marriage a wonderful time lmao is that what you mean
@billy was here  well there is beta
@xavier gage  they tried that shit once saying ancient greek spartans had gay relationship and such so if kratos was real he could have been gay
they ve homogenized everything  that s why i m picky these days. i refuse to get into a franchise unless i m already a fan or it s a trusted fan fanvored studio. insomniac is favored but i m worried about spider-man 2
@cold zero the wise  spartans didn t have gay relationships they committed pederasty.
in house playstation games are pretty much all clunky 3rd person open world rpgs  yawn.
i m just waiting for the adaptation where this beast is somehow made uglier. loved bella s performance but yeesh
i remember loving aloy in the first game. she felt like such a breath of fresh air in the times we are in with female characters in games. a respected father figure  had to use her mind and tools to survive  had to prove herself and only had an advantage because of technology not available to others. and of course the player.then the sequel  and apparently the first game s dlc but i didn t play it  came out and destroyed her character in both design and narrative. god am i so glad to have never played or looked into it past the first cutscene. that alone ruined it for me.
sigh  i was planning on diving back into forbidden west  maybe not now! i m sick of this woke crap bleeding into my various interests! i had a blast with zero dawn  and picked up forbidden west with the intention of playing it some more once my backlog cleared up somewhat! oh well  at least i ve got tears of the kingdom to look forward to!
god bless you kid. my daughters need more like you. you let them know being a gamer and christian is cool  thank you.
im fine with her having a love interest  im fine with her even having a lesbian love interest  what makes me fucking livid about this is it fucking came out of nowhere. two games there has been a slow burn build up with errand  and in this game they made a lot of progress i feel like. then this girl seyka  not even a super likeable character compared to most companions  one that spends most of her time with alloy being confrontational due to alloy not telling her everything  then nearly having a mental break down when she finally does  it just comes out of nowhere. no build up at all. if they put out more dlc and she was aloys companion in them and she stuck with her in game 3 and they were able to build an actual connection  then yeah. id be okay with it. but this was done to please the angry leftest and spit on her relationship with errand and spit in the face if the majority of the loyal fanbase. i was already mad they pulled this zenith out of their ass instead of having aloy bringing hephastus to heal which is what this dlc should have been about. i was beyond disappointed in this dlc from nearly all aspects.
characters having a traditional relationship seems almost taboo from western studios. it s a really bizarre time for anyone that just wants to escape from reality  only to see this pushed in every medium.
aloy to me always played as a character that didn t really have sexual or romantic feelings either way  which makes sense given how hard she was ostracized growing up as an outcast. she was a great avatar for the player that way because she was both familiar with and foreign to the game world. shoe-horning in a sexuality to her now is just tiresome.
what s weird is  in the main game  there was also an implied male love interest.
odd since the sun king dude was trying to wife her up in the main prologue and she basically told him to wait until she completed what she need to do  if you chose the  option
a woke game with a mary sue that turns out to be gay  color me shocked-_-
i agree completely  she has curved every love interest both male and female. not outright but more  not now  i have work to do before i can have a life  so i kept the trend thankfully they gave the choice in this dlc
i haven t played the dlc as of yet but i saw this coming when the main campaign revealed that elisabet was sleeping with tilda.  i knew they were going to shoehorn this into aloy s story.
i always thought that aloy and sunking avad would be a couple. i do not understand why aloy must team  up with a female marine. she already had her female warrior friend talanah. so why not give her a male companion   i am getting major tlou2 vibes here. great video !
i was cool with her turning down all of the people that tried to get with her in the first game.  it was fine with her just being single.
i don t agree that aloy wants to be a hero for the sake of being a hero.  she s a kind hearted person who wants to help people.  yeah she wants to save the world because the world is in danger of being destroyed.  what capable person would not act in that situation.  and she doesn t do it alone.  she has loads of help.  part of her arc is actually learning she can t do everything alone.  that s a bit of a bad take from you.
not every character has to have a love interest.
was so blinded with love with the first one that i didn t noticed much first time around.started playing the frozen wilds dlc and one of the first conversations you get they go with the  because i m a girl  . dropped it and didn t care for it for a while till i decided to go for a fresh run again and holy shoot! wokey trash is all over the place on the base game....
your instincts about the horizon sequel are correct  they do everything you re worried about  and more   and i think it soured a lot of fans- including myself- on the franchise. but if it s any consolation  the new machines are pretty rad  there are cool new ways to fight  there s one mission about las vegas that shouldn t be missed  and it s arguably the most gorgeous game i ve ever played.  i don t think you d like forbidden west better than the first one   i don t either  but it s still a  good  aaa game  objectively speaking.  i d love for you to play it  because i d love to hear your review
you re absolutely brilliant! some of the writing over the years has gotten lazy and sloppy for games like to tomb raider and horizon.  some of these game makers need to stop degrading ladies and need to see their true strength and loveliness and write them as fully developed and inspirational individuals. thank you so much melonie.
the biggest issue is that they made her love interest in a dlc. even though they tease with several romantic options in the main game. but a dlc character that we never saw suddenly is the one with the love option. plus to be fair aloy wasn t that compelling of a character in the games so this didn t add anything then a shoe horn in a dlc romance even though they had several other options in the main game.
just going by what she said at the end  i feel like mel would really enjoy shantae as a fun female character who has selfish motivations amongst other flaws but easily wins you over with personality and fun gameplay
i barely have time for open world games and yet i was pretty invested into horizon from start to finish. took me almost a year  but i explored virtually everything there was to do. i was hopeful there d be a sequel  but i knew something seemed... off  from the moment i saw the first screenshots until now. hard to describe. but now i m just gonna hold onto the fun i had playing zero dawn and maybe replay it someday  rather than pretend i won t just be disappointed by this haha
first game dlc was fine  even forbidden west did not lean to much on leftism pandering to the unaceptable level. but the burning shores dlc... that was pute woke pandering shit at its worst....
in what way was the narrative destroyed in forbidden west
@darth marr  like i said  all i watched was the opening cutscene and it was enough. after following clues and old messages  aloy finds out the woman in the old world is someone she s a clone of and looks for ways to make a connection to this long dead woman.jump into the second game and she declares how she s always seen her as a mother. no. she didn t. it doesn t make sense either  and she already had a father figure. so nice that he s brushed to the side for a character aloy never met outside of old recordings.also  nice username  i had marr in a machinima i made.
@end  thus i am  nice  thanks. yeah  it does bother me that rost is completely forgotten in the sequel. but at the same time  i know she was obsessed with knowing if she had a real family  who here parents were. what do you think of the far zenith
@darth marr  no idea. i didn t play it  remember
how is that relative
@the j0k3r  how is it not relevant
@the j0k3r because she s a gamer and also a has christian values.
@cucker tarlson  so  why do people need to  seek out others  to feel like something is cool  if you believe in something  believe it. if you dont find it cool or don t like something  why entertain it  weird take coming from a faith based belief system. you shouldn t need someone else to make you think something is cool.
@the j0k3r  personally i don t care if others think it s cool or not. i already know that christian views on sexuality   homosexuality in particular  are not going to be popular. i don t care. what i care about is that those who do believe the gospel are preaching it like they are supposed to. that means the entire gospel. not just the parts that make people feel good
@cucker tarlson  christian views on sexuality is a funny topic  considering you re supposed to love thy neighbor and the original text was referring to men lying with boys  pedophilia  not  homosexuality  . if people don t like homosexuality though  it s as simple as not doing it. the same as tattoos  piercings  abortions. just don t get them if you don t like it. let other people live their lives. not to go on a rant  sorry. but i agree. either believe something fully or don t at all. not because someone scared you with hell  not because someone tells you it s cool or not cool  but because you made the conscious decision to believe in something.
@the j0k3r  it s  love thy neighbour  hate not the sinner but the sin itself.  sexuality can be interpreted differently in christianity unlike gender. tattoos and piercings became a taboo in the holy roman empire because the heathens pagans who sacrificed animals and people  r ped and pillaged  murdered and slaughtered used to have them. you see  there is a certain line where live and let live is not applied. abortion should be legal but only in cases of evil acts like r pe where it is bred with only evil.
@the j0k3r  couple of things i want to address here. first loving thy neighbor does not mean that you lie to them and tell them what they want to hear. it means to tell him the truth and warn him to flee from the wrath to come. as we are commanded in leviticus 19 17   thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart  thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour  and not suffer sin upon him.  here  loving your neighbour is defined as rebuking him  and not allowing sin to come upon him.next  no the original text does not say men lying with boys. that is a progressive lie that has been told to try to justify sinful behavior. the greek word that has been translated to homosexuals in modern english language is arsenokoitai. it s a compound word   arsen  means man and  koite  or  koitas  or  koitai  depending on a verb or a noun means bed. it s men who bed with other men. even if you don t know any greek  you could find online or pull up the greek transliteration of these two verses. look at the septuagint  which is the greek translation of the hebrew bible  and then just look at the greek for the necessary passage in leviticus 18 and leviticus 20 and you ll see there  and in fact the words are right next to each other in leviticus 20  this word for man   arsen   and the word for bed   koitai  or  koite  .
@the j0k3r  i am a christian who doesn t particularly hate homosexuals or even trans people but i am fairly certain i ve read passages that have said men not shall not lie with men either.
this!!!
100
sounds like the last 15 years of my life... hehe
yes
yes  if your character is straight. i still remember one writer putting out two articles on ann  when she celebrating the male and female lead having a platonic relationship in one  and in other drooling over the  gay subtext  between two canon friends. that is  she openly rejoiced at the platonic development between a guy and a girl  and at the same time literally received ecstasy from the thought that there could be romance between friends. even at least in her head.
she seemed more like a girl that had no time for a relationship.
not every love interest needs to be lbgt either for that matter.
@adam fr  possibly  but in that case  it makes the sudden lgbt even weirder.
very agree!
melonie  overall i enjoyed both forbidden west and burning shores but the whole romance thing with seyka is downright ridiculous . i m so sick and tired of all of this crap  the fact that they force this mess down our throats is horrible. i m going to talk about this on my channel sometime this week  take care and god bless you melonie .
more specifically  not all women are gay.and because this is current year  it has to be interracial lesbians.
keeping it 100  they should ve worked on her personality rather than giving her a girlfriend
yeah love is overrated
facts. it s usually pretty corny anyways.
this and this. not having a romantic partner also felt like part of aloy following in the footsteps of elisabet sobek. she cared for the world and would risk her life for it  but there was a melancholy to her aloneness as well. it felt very thematic to an overarching story that was essentially about a great loss. giving her a love interest takes away from that.
aloy seemed more like an asexual person to me  she never showed any interest in anyone
@camila costa  so did nico from percy jackson didn t stop them did it
and if it is to have one it should be heterosexual unless the story and the characters earn it. because simply dropping at the 90th minute that  oh btw she s a lesbo  for absolutely no reason is so stupid and clearly pandering to the  modern western audience
@spongemonkey26  if it s alphabet i have zero interest in it. not my cup of tea. plus that kind of stuff is brainwashing kids.
but every female character must be lesbian. - sony
@kyle  euh  like yuna in ghost of tsushima
i seriously thought i was the only one who noticed .elisabet was indeed a genius  but the way she talked down to faro.then how ourea even treats aratak  like all he knows is just unga bunga erend  a capable warrior constantly talking about how much better his sister wasthen the hunters lodge and your sponsor  whew!
so she s a lesbian now  wasn t she suposed to rebuild civilization
you know... im glad they kept ashley and ada beautiful in re4 remake!no weird haircut  no lesbian shit  just good characters!
this is soooooooo romantic that i self-amputated and immediately started dialating. i have plenty of bud light on hand to ease the pain.
aloy could ve just been an incredible asexual character. one of elisabet sobek s key traits was that she was so driven by her purpose that she didn t pay any mind to pursuing any kind of romantic relationships  and in hzd  aloy reflected that perfectly. going back on that only serves to undermine her character  not even going into ruining her sense of purpose in hfw  in a really lazy way.but that s just it  they don t actually care about what it does to her character or the story. it s only about cowing to the corporate overlords in order to not get in trouble.all in all  i m really disappointed. i loved hzd  and i was looking forward to a pc port of forbidden west. but if they re just gonna ruin an amazing character for the sake of their esg score  i m gonna sit this one out. i m not going to participate in that.
when i played aloy in horizon zero dawn  i thought that she looked like a rather ordinary girl and i really liked that they didn t make her look like a super hot super model with huge boobs.she didn t look as good looking as hannah hoekstra that was the woman they modeled aloy after   but i think that was because of the graphics and gaming engine at the time that was the reason for that.i was a bit worried that they magically would improve aloy s looks a lot when making the forbidden west  but i was shocked when i saw how they made her look.i thought they might make aloy look more like hannah hoekstra  but they made aloy look even less like hannah hoekstra.i have no idea why they chose to degrade her looks when they even had better graphics to work with.and why did they make her face fatter and removed her muscles she has not exactly stopped climbing all sorts of cliffs and mountain walls.she has not exactly stopped jumping all sorts of obstacles.she has not exactly stopped fighting all sorts of monsters enemies  and that often in acrobatic ways.and that should make her face fatter and remove all her muscles i really would like to know how hannah hoekstra feels about how they have made her look like in the game.
ugh disappointing news. thanks for your take on this. great content.
watching paint dry is more exciting than aloy personality
aloy s focus  sense of duty made her a great character.
ooo love your hair today completely agree with you on choosing male characters in games sometimes. just started divison 2 up again and omg their female models are so ugly. so i made a hunky irishman instead  if you re gonna look at them for hours  they might as well be attractive.
thank you for this video  i had the game on my wishlist and this helped me to decide not to buy it. that they give you a choice in the matter makes it better but it feels forced.
i call upon the modder gods to unleash mods to preserve her as is and flip the bird at the trend
when you look at aloy s motivations it also becomes clear that she is a narcissist. in zero dawn aloy had a good reason and motivation. she wanted to know why she was born an outcast. in forbidden west however aloy does not want to save to world because she likes it or the poeple in it. she just does it because elisabeth created it.
this sucks. i was routing for errand and they were hinting that alloy and errand to get together. it s not enough to make strong a female character  they got to virtue signal her to a modern audience. drives me nuts! great video today! you look amazing too!
just deleted this game for space for another before i saw this video and now im glad i did  also you look amazing today melanie keep up the positive vibes
i remember playing mass effect and being like  oh you can romance a party member  that s kind of interesting .. apparently all these creators thought the same. now i just roll my eyes whenever some  love interest  comes along. now i just find it all super cringe.
i felt it was so forced and rushed and it makes no sense as in the first and main story in fw she seemed to have a bit of a crush on both varl and prince avad. if we had met seika earlier and fought along side her multiple times and if they had paired them in the third it would have felt more organic. the way they wrote this romance  was so contrived it made me pretty annoyed. not only that  elisabet was tilda s lover so i would have liked aloy being her own person and not a carbon copy of elisabet to the t  especially since we had dialogue choices before leaving the sun kingdom where she shows interest in the prince  so what was the point i wonder  i don t understand why we have to have protagonists have love interests in general  why  can t we just have protagonists doing their job and nothing else
aloy looked like a real person  because she was modeled after a real person. she was a dutch actress  hannah hoekstra
at least they gave an option to say no. which suggest that will be forgotten in the third part as they won t do three different plots for all three completely different choices people could pick.
she was never alluded to be gay in the first game  she was also more beautiful in dawn ! also  the one character that she has some sort of  chemistry  is with the sun king avad  in both games. but then again  we re in 2023 where everyone s gay so...
basically it ends up being interpreted as  hollywood goes woke   and ironically speaking the setting is in a post-apocalyptic los angeles  and the entertainment industry s actions leaning more to making movies with  woke  content. the choices at the end of the dlc never actually rejects seyka  the brutal choice plays out like a denial of her feelings  its there   while the other response is similar to reciprocation with a wait period till they can resolve the nemesis world problem.
no  she was never supposed to rebuild civilization.she is supposed to help rebuild gaia to prevent the world from falling apart and also somehow defeat nemesis.
@niko belic  i miss hades
@zeros origin  hades was pretty dope!
@zeros origin  hades was based. all we can do now is hope that nemesis succeeds...
she s not a lesbian.if you follow the story and all  truly  then you ll see having a relationship is nowhere near a priority.
@docbravo  you can be a lesbian and not be in a relationship.i am straight and am not in a relationship.  you can sexually be into someone and not be in a relationship.even in burning shores  even though alloy kisses seyka  if you chose to do so  her relationship with her isn t a priority.and it shouldn t  with nemesis on the way and some of the sub functions still running around free.
she doesn t have to be breeding cow for that dude what the hell is with this concept.
@niko belic  tbh i hope the beginning of the next game is capturing hephaestus and then nemesis appears. i wonder if seyka will appear   i didnt hate her as much as most people did but i didnt like her
please don t bring bad luck.
guerrilla games dropped the ball big time with the sequel. that esg score is more important than making a decent game. plus they made it look as if alloy ran face first into bee hive and she went into anaphylactic shock.
watch nexus nuke those mods from orbit like they did with spider-man.
thank you so much  you are always so awesome!  d
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie! keep on being an inspiration!
@andrew robb a modern what dude get over it strong female characters exist in real life in gay in bi people exist worldwide so get use to it
@random reactions tv  no
@random reactions tv  fuck no. they do exist  sure. but the problem is that now days that is all they are talking about. it s fucking ridiculous. there is no balance.
erend was definitely who i thought she would end up with!!
@random reactions tv  no one is saying they dont exist  we re just sick of every character being made gay for no reason  its become a trend at this point.
i just finished the legendary version of mass effect  and most of the  relationships  are still fun and some are surprisingly well written! the shepard-liara t soni dynamic during the trilogy is really something. nothing to do with this super cringe dlc.
@alundra  yes
@the mighty crixus  yes
@fanzon  because god calls me to.
@random reactions tv  you re supposed to cure illness  not get used to it.
@badookum  no it s not i m sick of all these characters being straight not everyone in the world is straight you know me in my friends was close in there girl we was so close people thought we was dating but i m gay in she s never clam to be straight
@random reactions tv  you realize that the vast majority of people in the world are straight  right  or were you never taught the birds and the bees
@anedime  you know if your straight in your a boy you can get a disease with a female to right lol did you know that
@andrew robb  nah i think it s cuz she looks nice and she says exactly what you want to hear. you bought it when she says  yeah being a hero is only a thing for men.   like cmon dude no way you don t see through the grift. go on  give her another  100  she ll definitely respect and love you!
@random reactions tv  praying for your mental recovery.
@random reactions tv  no  if a character is hinted to be a romance interest then they should be one down the line  not shafted into the corner for a modern audience.
@random reactions tv  wtf do stds have to do with this
i dont know what games you guys have been playing  but she was never into errand.  nor was she into avad... she even turned petra down.  i don t really get the complaints... i m a straight guy  as i assume most of this games base is as well.  playing as aloy  do you want to romance a guy   i dont...
before the whole zo thing i kind of had ship her and varl..but i think it might would had been better if she just stay single cause she seen the type that don t have time for relationships.
@random reactions tv  i m not sure that s the point he was trying to make. unfortunately  people  such as social justice warriors  love to confuse something as innocent as the desire to see errand and aloy expanded upon romantically  since it was hinted at plenty of times   with something as vile as bigotry.. that is not the issue here. in my opinion. do strong women  gay or bi or whatever  exist ! yes. i m sure they do. and they can be represented. dont be quick to jump to conclusions. all of what was stated was pretty clear and having to deal with this common theme of  if i m gay or trans etc. then i m oppressed and everyone needs to acknowledge me  lift me up  and bend the knee  is just bullshit. because  1. life just isnt like that for most people. and the vast majority of people judge others on the content of their character  not their identity.  2. what people are fed up with is the consistent down pour of this  agenda  being shoved down our throats. thrown on any and all media products which is then  consciously and subconsciously   targeted toward our children etc. and that isn t acceptable. not for everyone  atleast. this is what s been so devisive. race  gender  identity. this is whats caused so many people to completely squash the idea of gay trans etc. because having an normal conversation is rarely productive. people who have adopted radical ideology are not open to discussion. not open to understanding.  it s now a lose lose for anyone who wants to critique something. leading back to the idea of you either bend the knee or get canceled or worse.
errand was badass
stop giving this much money andrew. you cannot afford it.
@random reactions tv  not in an apocalyptic setting where procreation is a must. cough tloutoo cough. they exist yes but this is forced because sony is on the esg system and thus us literally their main curriculum in playstation university.remember geruila boss knew kneel cuckmann.sony nowadays had this strategy that go normal on the initial release then after getting a wider audience  it goes full 180. tlou dlc pioneered it. uncharted lost legacy authenticate it. geruila follow suit. bet god of war is next. chris judge wearing that shirt in the gaming awards and cory is an advocate and the game already garner plenty of supporters. it s just a matter of when now.
bruh  give me some of that chedder lol
@norman readdis  who cares if god of war is next lol in are you gay because your worried a little to much about fictional characters the gay the gay nobody should care i don t even know why she make a video on this in i like it there a beautiful couple
always felt like errend was looked at more as a beta by aloy lol
@fanzon  lmaoo  he thinks that with enough  100s she ll date him.
@random reactions tv i m bi and i don t claim this movement so does my friends. it s forced and it s literally making the real community bad reputation like its their only way to exist is  validation .
@tsuyokunokyojin  simps gonna simp - that s how this world works you know
another stocker
@random reactions tv  so basically what you re saying is that you re on board with whatever fad is trendy over portraying something more realistic.  the problem is you don t seem to understand the consequences when this is taught as reality to our children.  7.2  of the population identifies this way so why do 90  of media keep representing this as the norm
@the_scion  in it s a lot of gay people on this world in straight people so it is normal just because you don t live this way doesn t mean it s not normal
@random reactions tv  doing this    doesn t automatically make your point valid. just saiyan.
@random reactions tv  i will go with the same answer forever  no
@lvthor ascending  doing what what makes my point valid is nobody has nothing to say now let me ask you this question why are you straight you tell me in i well tell you why i m gay in i just show all this people up by my self lol one person
@cats  lol in so we ll i yes
@random reactions tv  i ll answer that with flying colors  i m straight because my unit down there knows where to go without needing directions. also  are you liking your own comments
they never hinted at that. in the first game she makes it clear that she isn t interested.
@edwin fern ndez  agreed  being a generic powerful woman stereotype is now a prerequisite for a woman existing in a lead role and it s sad
@badookum  not every character is gay  that s such hyperbole.  how bout we play a game   you list a gay character and then i ll list a straight one.  we go back and forth and the first person who cant name a character loses and pays the winner 1000 bucks.  you game
@melonie mac go boom  i am a guy and i really tried to build a female face in for my female character in elden ring in but it s hard. even bodywise it s hard. am i doing it wrong
they made it clear she wasnt going to get with errand....like every time he hit on her she wasnt into him. especially when the only person she showed real interest in was varl.
@random reactions tv  the thing is they are not this abundant now every piece of media has these types of characters.
@random reactions tv  why does everything you say read as though a cat stepped on your phone and accidentally hit the send arrow
@random reactions tv  are you even paying attention   two of sony s biggest games now have a lesbian main character.  gay people at most make up 1  of the world s population.  what are the odds of having two that are leads   it s never been about them existing but what they re clearly pushing
a guy a used to work with just told me this story a couple days ago and it makes me sick thinking about it. he said his daughter has these 2 friends that are sisters. he said they were these really beautiful girls  like 14 years old. so the one sister is seeing a counselor and the counselor suggested that maybe the reason she has difficulty connecting with people is that she s not really a girl  she s a boy.so he br@inw@shes her into believing she s a boy  she starts taking all these male hormones and whatever else and now this once beautiful little girl looks like a twisted freak of nature. now she s going to have her breasts completely removed soon.this counselor br@inwashed her  it never even would have occurred to her that she was really a boy if that pos counselor wouldn t have put that bs in her head.and the parents actually went along with this crap every step of the way. never even occurred to them that it s strange that she started seeing this counselor and now suddenly thinks she s a boy.so now she has all these new friends and is getting all this attention and special treatment  which could influence some of her friends to do the same just for the attention.in a sane world this counselor would be fired asap and the parents would be arrested for child abuse. it s scary that society has been ind0ctrinated to see this child mutilation as acceptable. apparently the mother thinks it s the greatest thing ever and that everyone should do it.this s@tanic world just keeps getting worse and worse. it was slow and gradual at first so people wouldn t notice but now they have the people under such extreme mind c0ntrol that it will continue much more rapidly in this downward spiral.
i guess you are being intentionally clueless.  yes gay people exist but i do notice they are massively over represented in media and have been for at least the last few years.  i ve been saying for years they should have a channel or streaming service that specifically caters to the lgbt market like different channels cater to other markets.  the vast majority of people are straight so it s ridiculous to try to act like that isn t true.   i ve read stories or watched stuff with good gay characters although if there is a romantic aspect i want to see a male and a female so i ll pass on this  not sure why the game just doesn t let you choose who to be with    but i can understand why people roll their eyes when they see yet another gay character being pushed. i m black and i think it s dumb to race swap characters to black for no reason or to push a character simply because they are black but have lousy writing.
@random reactions tv  random no life person in internet
@larosha1  if they had their own channels and stuff to cater to them  it would become painfully apparent how few people are interested in it  so they have to force it on us.also they re trying to br@inwash as many people as possible into their woke religion. that s why it started gradually and subtle  but that phase is over now and the entire entertainment industry is pushing full speed ahead with this bs.it s almost like the entire entertainment industry is controlled by the same people. it would be way too much of a coincidence that they all start pushing this crap at the same time and pace  even if they lose money doing so.
i was a aloy errand relationship if there was going to be one at all. only one that made any sense chemistry wise.
the guy with moustache
@jack m  it s sick because what young person doesn t get confused  self conscious  have trouble connecting with people  and unhappy with the changes their body goes through  it s literally every single one  then these  therapists  turn these very natural emotions into an excuse to plant these children on the train to complete physical  mental  sexual  and spiritual destruction  all because they had the symptoms of normal teen development...
@random reactions tv  nah.
@jacob garza  yes
@random reactions tv but in reality  no matter how strong a female lesbian character is  the male character is always stronger. cope.
@ryan malone this is why women can t have nice things. when we play a character who is a woman  we women want her straight.
@random reactions tv  strong female character in real life aren t always ugly and woke though. you can t justify the overused woke trope at this point.
if not erend then freaking sun king avad... but dammit!!!
erend is my boy and honestly i was kinda rooting for him to end up with aloy aswell since he seems like a really loyal fella but so be it  i m not gonna complain about it now. it s kinda funny how people are losing their shit and bomb reviewing the dlc just for this one tiny storypoint.
@random reactions tv  i m going to guess you re a child since nothing you re saying makes any sense.
i always wonder what that modern audience might be.
@zero todona  that would be a valid argument if that was the argument... but it s not.  i m merely pointing out the hypocrisy.  i m with the people who point out how the woke crybabies are always going out of their way looking for a reason to complain about something... and now i m watching those same people go out of their way to complain about something.
@random reactions tv  the amount that it is espoused and talked about in media is not relative to the actual percentage of gay people who actually exist in society.
@cucker tarlson  lol if that s the cast then straight people is getting disrespected to because of all the straight people in video games
@random reactions tv  i didn t say gay people were getting disrespected. i said that the amount of gay characters inserted into media is disproportionate to the amount that actually exist in society. they are a extreme minority so i do not understand the huge focus on them.
@cucker tarlson  actually gays in straight are really close in society so look it up really got damn close lol so why not have us in games lol in we keep getting bigger in we re not slowing down ok i was in la flirting with boys in they flirted back in this youtuber did a pole in he have 35 million followers in there all gay accept one person so your point
lol i have good relationships with my friends that are girls people even though we was dating because of how close we was but i m gay
this! it seemed like they were hinting at those two together.  now the part where she is flirting and blushing at avad means nothing.
im gay. be gay. you already are harry.
yeah  headcanon it s sun king avad to me. their marriage would ve brought together all the tribes and united the land. makes perfect sense politically.
gay means happy and happy means gay!
@seth rios  same  i just imagined she went back to meridian sometime after zero dawn s ending and reconnected. it made flawless sense  narrative wise. i didn t really see it going any other way  once she decided to finally settle down.
@lou sassole  it could have also continued the series with her off-spring  opened up a lot of new opportunities to maintain diplomacy between the tribes  and give rise to new enemies wanting to bring back the dominance of the robosaurs and the old-world s technocracy. as you said  the entire thing would have written itself if they had just played by the rules of their own lore  and the sensible world-building that had already been established.
kotallo!!! i wanted her with kotallo!! erend was more big brother vibes  she clearly had feelings for varl until he broke her heart when he fell for someone else...... i am livid! with this outcome! we weren t even given a choice in the matter!
each time i watch the video and during all of that i think  melonie is so cute. i like that she keeps talking and smiling.
i m in the middle of forbidden west and find that they made it more expansive from zero dawn but at the same time more convoluted and tedious.  i m not surprised they did this to aloy  i would have liked if she would be more like d from vampire hunter d  wandering america the way d wanders the frontier
funfact  in horizon zero dawn  aloy looked like the identical twin sister of a german  ex-  twitch streamer. she calls herself an activist and even she doesn t play forbidden west anymore because it became too extreme for her.
it no longer surprises me  it has already become the law of the western gaming industry
i just want lara to have a love interest if it s kurtis. but only if lara and kurtis keep the aod personality
i think not every protagonist needs a love interest. some stories can just be a person finding adventure and asking questions of who they are in the world without a love interest. specially if your world is something like horizons  you would not have time for such a romance trying to literally save the world.
the changes they made to aloy s look is exactly why i don t plan on ever playing forbidden west. i bought zero dawn on gog but was turned off by aloy s new look. also  have you seen the immortals of aveum trailer  there s a female character who literally looks like goro from mortal kombat. they couldn t make her look like sheeva. oh  no. they went straight for goro.
the best part about aloy was that she just had one goal in mind and no real romantic pulls in the game aside from some minor speech checks you could opt out of. guess i wont be getting this dlc when the pc port comes out
was talking with a coworker about this  and he brought up a great point. it doesn t matter who they want to be with. but don t make the choice for me  if there wasn t a clear indication to start with.
of course she did. ashly burch is a super woke sjw so i never thought they d let aloy just be aloy. they made elisabet gay so it was only a matter of time before they did it with aloy. even though you can flirt with sun king avad they gave you the choice to.
i played and beat horizon forbidden west  and it was overall an amazing game. now  when you play the game  i don t think aloy was made  uglier.  those claims were just very specifically picked screenshots. when in action  aloy still looks fine. about the  hero complex  bit is a more complex and better written then just  hero for the sake of hero.  because she s a genetic copy of elizabet sobek she s the only one who can open the old facilities. its not a  i m the hero  idea  its  i am the only one with the genetic key that can open these facilities  and i don t want anyone else to get hurt for my sake.  she simply doesn t want to feel responsible for anything that can happen. the message of the plot is about her learning not to carry the burden all alone. overall  the story was good  the emotional highs and lows don t hit as well as zero dawn  but its hard to top what they did in the first game. however  there is an issue. . .now  representation when done right isn t a bad thing  necessarily. i am a christian too  but we are not supposed to judge  it creates an  us vs them  that helps nobody. same gender relationships  while i may not understand it personally  if its how they feel at home  then that s great. representation in media helps them feel seen and respected and that they are not alone. that can only help when its done right and they are given proper respect.however  in horizon forbidden west  the ratio of straight to same gender relationships of named couples you encounter in the game makes me wonder how there is a sustainable human population in this region. after nearly 100 ing the base game  it seems like the next generation in this game s region would consist of maybe around 20 people. 1st gay encounter  ah  that s nice  well written representation  good on you guerilla!  2nd  ah  surprised to see another so soon  but hey  good for the community.  5th  . . . ok. . i guess   10th   ok this is going overboard.  by the end i struggle to count how many living  straight characters are in the game. seems like nearly everyone who is in a relationship is doing so with someone from the same gender. while representation can be good if done right and respectfully  this was oversaturation where it simply doesn t work for the sustainability of the world itself. another example below  major story spoilers!!!!! so tilda is a bad guy because she s a simp for elizabet!   the ending of zero dawn made it very clear sobek was straight  she simply didn t have time to start a family due to the faro plague. in the end of fw tilda says she saw aloy s life through the focus network  and was inspired by the fact aloy did more good  and had greater feats in a mere fraction of a fraction of tilda s entire life. this is elizabet sobek practically reborn  her truest self. in the end tilda helps aloy take down the zeniths but then tries to force aloy to join her on a escape craft to a new world safe from a new threat. how tilda should have been written could instead be maybe along the lines of aloy represented the best of humanity  and if this world is doomed and few can be saved from the coming threat  then she would take aloy along with her and maybe synthesize more life based off her dna and rebuild humanity with the gaia backup combined with far zenith tech. instead its simply tilda loved elizabet  and elizabet never reciprocated that because she was straight. tilda just wanted to steal this chance to be with elizabet again in the form of aloy. again  whatever gender someone is attracted to  you find who you love  who you feel most like  you  around  who makes you happy  great! i will pray that you keep your right to choose and live happily! however i think it was starting to go overboard. in hfw overall still a great game  but it felt like they gone out of their way to make nearly every relationship you hear about same gendered! varl and zo are one of the few straight relationships i can think of in this game. avad and erend were valid candidates for aloy  though avad was giving me the impression he was getting a touch  . . . pushy. i was honestly voting aloy gets with varl  but the story had other plans. oh  and interpret this how you will  but the main villain of burning shores  is straight and trying to manipulate women to love him  trying to find a woman who can act on the same level as his late wife  who was also an actress.
and this is why souls and souls-like games are the best. its about the bosses  exploration  combat in a run down broken world with danger around every corner... theres little time in those worlds for my character to have a love interest.
ever since i saw shots of the sequel  my head canon has been that aloy died of a shellfish allergy so i ve only ever played the original and i plan to leave it there.
i don t know how you even have the patience to keep following these things to keep making these videos lol. great job nonetheless. i don t even know what to say today  just... happy monday.
man  i actually liked aloy s character in the first game. an outcast on a journey to discover who she is while also having to learn to trust and work with the people who alienated her  it was compelling. now she s just a tool for virtue signaling
always strikes me as silly how they break the urgency of a story to have two characters suddenly sit about idly talking about their feelings for each other. they  did this constantly in star trek discovery. some disaster is about to occur  we have hardly any time to stop it...but...lets hang on a few and talk about who is in love with who. why should i as someone watching or playing a story have any urgency if the characters don t seem too concerned  this is usually because their agenda is to wedge a relationship into the story come hell or high water.
at the zero dawn  we can see aloy interested more in what is going on with all around then relationship  but in the meanwhile you can observe some interest with avad and erend... by the end of the game you discovered she is more interested in erend... when begins the forbidden west is clear they have feelings between them both  but suddenly we forgot about erend and discover that elisabeth sobeck was lover of tilda. i would be more satisfied if they kept aloy like the first game  with no relations to enyone... i am not against that  but especific in this game sound forced  like it was made to satisfy someone...
if they wanted romance they should had at least give us a choice to romance a certain amount of characters or basically not at all
i can just imagine what they will do to aloe s character model in the rumored horizon zero dawn remaster!
yes to this
this! at first he hates her and she feels so uncomfortable  but they fight together  get to know each other and finally discover that they are a perfect match. great relationship arc.
indeed  i just hope the woke disease wont reach the east or at least wont get affected as bad.
so happy that capcom didn t do this to ashley in resident evil 4 remake.
@norwegian blue they re going in the esg as well with street fighter. they re just subtle with it. they literally make ada not too sxual because  reasons .they race swap morrison in dmc5. change juri s outfit. etc. it s just not as egregious as the west but you can see the signs.
that s why i only play japanese games. sure  some of them do have lgbt in there  but it doesn t feel forced. not like western games.
@half-vampire  i hope it doesn t reach the east also. i also hope it dies in the west
@norwegian blue  they couldn t care less about wokeness. i ve seen people say re4 remake is somehow  woke   when it literally had ada being a supreme girlboss in the original  and the plot was far more politically driven. they actually took all the wokeness out of it  and people still had a kneejerk reaction.
@lou sassole  wokeness did not exist in 2004 mate. at least have an understanding of what it is first. it doesn t mean politics in games. also what politically driven  ada was not a girlboss stereotype  she was a femme fatale you d find in a bond movie or like catwoman. ada s attirtude changes are legitimate complaints as the remake acting is not as good as any other version of her.re4 original was an 80 s style campy action movie plot.
@argent wolf  i knew i should have worded that better. i suppose what i mean is  it had more elements that would be considered  woke  today.
@lou sassole  it doesn t. this is what  woke  is  woke  w k  nounthe colloquial term for intersectional ideology. intersectional ideology is characterized as an ideology routed in marxist  socialist propaganda integrated into a number of different western social movements based in class  race  sexual preference  identity  religious and political preferences most pronounced in critical race theory  intersectional feminism and the lgbtq   not to be confused with the early 2000s lgbt movement  and dei  diversity  equity  inclusion . the goals and actions of the woke movement can be characterized by a belief that all people belong to either a victim or an oppressor class. there is a hierarchy that assigns virtue or privilege based on perceived group identity and members of the woke movements will form angry mobs to attack others inside or out of the group to destabilize systems  reroute resources to perceived oppressed groups and attack outgroups. victim status will be used to pressure and control it s believers and outside groups into submission under the guise of being tolerant and empathetic. activists will use it as a shield to defend against any form of retaliation. the woke activists will lie  manipulate  bully and propagandize others by claiming any opposition is a form of hatred or bigotry. the woke  ideology do not recognize any form of objective truths and only aspire to power and  their truths. synonyms  intersectionality  social justice. marxism. communism. so in a woke re 4  remake. leon would be written as pretty stupid and ashley would be overly confident like a girl who needs no man  like a typical activist or twitter user in 2023  as opposed to her trusting leon and bonding as she does. other examples making it woke would be race swapping leon or ashley out of nowhere. which they did iin resident evil  welcome to raccoon city movie as well as make  him extremely dumb when  while in re 2  he was a rookie cop on first day  he wasn t stupid in the game.i also disagree with the ones calling resident evil 4  remake woke as well  they re being reactionary  as a lot of japanese media fans in the west are. a lot of them also think luis  ballistics  line was censored  but if you actually look into his character s improvements  they made him a much more compelling character imo so it made sense to change that scene s dialogue.
@argent wolf  sigh. touch . guess i was reaching. i know what woke is  essentially  but to see an actual definition is beneficial. i m old  and tired  and it takes a lot to keep up with all the new trendy lingo. no cap  fam. bet. totes cray cray  am i right  my kids don t even know what that guff means. but i digress.luis was definitely an improvement. his inclusion in the redone mining cart segment was likely the highlight of the entire outing for me.
@lou sassole   yeah  sorry if it came accross as strongly worded. i got fed up with people on both sides of politics not really understanding what it is or accusing things of being woke that aren t. so i created the definition to explain it properly. like some things can be woke when put together with other things. for example aloy being lesbian by itself isn t woke  but how she was written to lead to that reveal makes it woke  because she really acts unlike herself in this dlc.forbidden west is written with woke ideology in mind  but for most of the game  it didn t get in the way of having fun for me. zero dawn wasn t woke  just the story has a strong environmentalist bias  but also provides an answer to solving it  which i liked.also yeah! that part was great. i love that luis got ore screentime. most of my criticisms are basically  not enough face to face screentime with saddler before you take him on  and a few gameplay things  like how the ammo is.
aannnnnnd like that the horizon seriesjust died.2017-2023
that why i am going to buy a switch this year
@argent wolf what s the source for that definition   urban dictionary doesn t count as a good source.
@gamer7916  i wrote it myself  using several years of knowledge  experience  and study of pretty much everything i included  becase nobody seems to be able to correctly explain what iis  woke   even going as far as to define things that aren t.
@argent wolf  the fact that you said it s synonymous with marxism and communism tells me you don t know what you re talking about.
want some irony  fortnite kept her original appearance unlike the devs of horizon who butchered her.
this! you took the words out of my mouth. it seemed like they were hinting at those two together.  now the flirting and blushing means nothing.
elizabeth and alloy could be bi.
at least they didn t make a huge part of the games based on elizabets sexuality. it was mentioned in hfw with tilda  but it was never hammered into you. which is perfectly fine.
@chefboi  ardeeznutz   true
@chefboi  ardeeznutz   i agree.this is the way to add lesbian or gay characters in a game or movie.it s just a small part of who they are  a side note  not their whole personality.
@niko belic  right  that s what i m saying. like if we re going to find a middle ground with people  especially people that we initially see as the  enemy  because of the loud minority that make those groups of people look bad  then at least integrate these things in a more logical and not so saturated way.
i  frankly  don t understand how ashly burch keeps getting work. her voice acting is mediocre at best  she couldn t even do a rural american accent when she voiced sasha in attack on titan. she has zero range. i m even less impressed by her producing writing. i suppose connections are all that matter in the industry  not skill or talent. glad i decided not to get this game  though i have the first on pc not that i was going to buy a ps5 for it anyway  but it only further validates my choice. like the first game  it should ve focused on exploration and building up lore  and doubled down on that.
@niko belic being gay is taught  in a post apocalyptic world  it would never exist.
@zero todona  this world isn t post apocalyptic in the way we think about it.it s pretty much a new start on a relatively clean world.plus  besides the machines  there were little threats to the new human populations since stage ii wildlife  large predators  hadn t been reseeded.
the only good character ashley burch did was tiny tina  and because her brother wrote it  not because of her
they also give you the choice to kiss seyka in the dlc  funny how that always gets missed out
remember kneel cuckman knew horizon s boss.here s the receipt.https   youtu.be pzomi_vxflsand to add more context  playstation university s main curriculum is diversity subjects aside making a career about in the gaming industry and they re all base in commiefornia. nuff said.
now  i lost much respect for ashley burch  did anyone know she was in attack on titan
@zero todona literally tloutoo. lol. it s a progressive power fantasy.
@niko belic the machines literally wipe the civilization to near extinction. even the trailer from 2015 e3 had said this.
why is ashley burch free from criticism. hey ash whatcha playin   was raunchy and made masturbation jokes. how is this not considered inappropriate these days lol
@wayne fowler it s the same as tlou 1st dlc. they think virtue signaling means  fanservice . lolnot surprising horizon s boss knew kneel cuckmann.source https   youtu.be pzomi_vxflsgod of war is next with cory as an advocate and chris judge s with that virtue signaling shirt he wore in the gaming awards.
@kendon l. taylor not until i read this thread!
yeah.
@animavox  people in the entertainment industry no longer get hired based on their abilities  they get hired because they re sjw.that s why the entire entertainment industry is going downhill.they want the writers  directors  actors  everyone to share their same stupid woke views. they don t care about hiring the best anymore. that s why little indie developers like team cherry with 3 or 4 people can put out a game better than many of the big triple a games.those 3 or 4 guys in team cherry are passionate about making good games  they re focus isn t pushing woke bs into their games like these big companies.this is why the big games take so many years and still release unfinished and require huge day one patches even when they have hundreds of staff and millions of dollars. then you have individual people on their computers very quickly releasing mods that improve the visuals  frame rates  and other things that the billion dollar companies couldn t get right themselves
sun king avad makes way more sense politically. but i only played zero dawn  so not sure what happens between them in forbidden west.
@niko belic most people live in a tribe. even with  tech  it s tribal. aloy is unique because she knows the truth.
@norman readdis trust me i know. ellie was straight in the lou. she had a naked man mag.
@zero todona  and was an outcast and remember  the nora were matriarchal. unlike our ancient human tribes.
@zero todona tlou is mainly bruce straley s vision and direction  kneel even stated bruce is responsible for the story direction even if they head butt on the ideas. the dlc happened after he left neutered dog during his simping for anita and that  i have this secret agenda  conference. kneel waited to insert his own narrative without resistance. like how he slithered in the uncharted 4 project taking all the credits from amy hennig because he added nadine and tweak a few things.kneels a narcissistic progressive nut job.pretty sure he had a hand why this happened.
@niko belic  in woke there is no such things as bi.
@star rain   lgbtq  dafuq does the b stand for
@niko belic  butch
@star rain  lol  i like the answer.
@norman readdis  after tlou2 i m done with naughty dog. i was very grateful for those leaks that saved me from wasting my money on that crap.pretty soon indie games will be the only way to avoid this woke bs. thankfully indie developers keep getting better and better. hollow knight was better than most modern aaa games  and dead cells is also an amazing game.hoping more of these indie developers start pushing out games of that quality. it s still unbelievable to me that a team of 3 people can put out a huge  amazing game like hollow knight but these multi million dollar companies with hundreds or thousands of employees take just as long  if not longer  to put out a game  and every single one requires a large day one patch.
@chefboi  ardeeznutz   true  but there were a suspiciously large amount of lgb characters in that game especially the side quests  to the point i was left wondering how the human species propogated. welp   if this is the direction games are going  might as well not buy the ps5
@kendon l. taylor  nope. because i watched the anime with subs
@viktor vondoom  i personally didnt notice a large amount of lgbt characters  unless there was something i missed. in terms of getting the ps5  you should still get it. don t let this game stop you from getting one.
@chefboi  ardeeznutz  there was a lot of push making lbgt more prominent in any industry  comics has already made most initial straight characters to gey. the rot is just spreading to the gaming industry and you ll notice this soon enough. it s not tbat you don t notice because you don t pay attention. that s how overton window works.get a ps5 and don t buy their woke 1st party tittles. but i rather him buy switch instead. sony is trying to go the xbox route where you got police feom  offensive  chats.
@jack m i m done with it after i saw his  secret agenda  conference speech before the dlc and him simping for anita sharkeesian.
@niko belic actually some very  very old tribes did used to have female leaders. they got conquered very easily.  shrugs
@zero todona  any proof of this  gay people have historically existed for a long time.even ex christians have said they were raised traditionally and still ended up having attraction to same sex.
@norman readdis  cory didn t even make the second gow and he likely won t the next
@zero todona  ellie and the naked man magazine for the last goddamn time has been used to say she was gay lol. she literally jokes at it and has no real response also she didn t have it she stole it from bill who was also gay to spite him.you guys are using a scene that has been argued the other way nothing in that scene says she was straight since she was mostly just being her rebellious teen self not using it for eye candy.
@norman readdis  amy hennig s uc4 was scrapped dude she wanted sam as a villain.so neil made a different script.
@chandller burse santa monica is swapping directors. cory is still very involved in the project as the producer.
@chandller burse that s just one thing that s change. all of it are still amy s. kneel s addition is just nadine but the scripts and plots was already done by amy  he just tweak it.https   youtu.be 5fdukvp3mlethe words came from sully himself.
@norman readdis  ok  good cory made 2018 which honestly i was a bit disappointed by ragnarok anyways
@norman readdis  at least someone has a damn link for once
@chandller burse prepare to be more disappointed on the 3rd installment.
@chandller burse i will always bring receipt to my argument as long as yt doesn t bury it yet. i love playstation since it s first inception  it s my own holiday every sony e3 events  i never mis one and was almost about to apply on the playstation university. but this political narrative took place and i started to wake up. you should be as well. i m pointing out the corruption of the industry because i love gaming. i don t wamt to be a consumer that this  developers  hated. i m a customer that have a give and take relationship on the company with valid criticism and community input.
@norman readdis  i really don t care anymore life has bigger issuesbesides i want to try the devil may cry series anyways now
@norman readdis  i just like playstation for the exclusives mostly and i like the controller design.the consoles use to look good when the ps2 was around.but obsessive with them is odd.and honestly sony s current titles are not that amazing the last of us 1 i admit i still have some resentment for since nd favors it so dang much
@norman readdis  the industry has always been corrupt probably.gaming industry for the most part is dying of exhaustion as far i hear.
@norman readdis  i don t even plag horizon for another thing all i hear is that its beautiful but also hear its generic as crap.and also released right before elden ring.
haha it can be draining sometimes. thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  always happy to drop by.
just because she s gay  weird how her liking both guys and girls takes you out. why can t it be considered normal or ok
@julian davis  i couldn t care less that she s gay dude  i m more upset that they made her into a boring ass mary sue. here s what i would ve done with her character in the sequel. let s say two years or so have passed since hzd and everything seems to be peaceful. aloy has settled down with a partner  male or female  it really doesn t matter tbh  and for the first time in her life she s happy. she s always been an outcast and now she finally feels like a normal person with someone who loves and accepts her. then  hades returns and it s time to save the world again and fulfill her duty. at first she s much like she was in the first game  determined to get it done and not accepting help from people. but then things start to turn to crap  people close to her start dying  maybe her partner gets gravely wounded in battle or something idk. that s when she starts to feel conflicted  bc she realizes she can t handle the pressure of having to save humanity after being an outcast her whole life. she also realizes that she s putting her life at risk for a society that shunned her rather than just being happy with her partner like she wants. she starts to question herself  maybe starts to miss rost and his training  wishing he was there to give her advice or motivate her to carry on. after spending the entire first game going on a journey of self discovery she realizes that maybe she s not cut out for saving the world by herself. the problem is  that s what she was created to do  she has no choice. her character arc would be one of the pressure of having to deal with insanely expectations for someone who s essentially been a nobody for most of her life bc she was alienated by society. look  i m not saying it s shakespeare  but it s something  which is better than nothing.
@julian davis  because it s not normal nor is it okay  and that s according to the cdc.
@billy was here  .....huh
@strahinjagov  not bad not bad
@julian davis can t go into more detail because it will be yeeted to the shadowrealm.
@julian davis she literally wasn t gay from the start
@zero todona  was she not flirty with both males and females based on our player choices  genuine question because i haven t finished the first game
@julian davis  there s no flirty dialogue options in either game  this ain t mass effect
@zero todona  her not being gay and her sexuality not being known are not the same
also  the relationship goals in this situation makes zero sense. from a storytelling perspective  aloy and this girl have zero future together. so they ve written themselves into a corner  just like tlou2 .
always strikes me as silly how they break the urgency of a story to have two characters suddenly sit about idly talking about their feelings for each other. in the burning shores  there s actually very little of that. there s discussion on the missions and events  around londra and seyka s sister  seyka s just irritation at aloy keeping seyka  need to know  for a good chunk of the run time. it isn t until the expansion s epilogue that there s what could rightly be called a discussion of feelings. its not da or me  where you re talking about personal feelings with every squadmate in between missions.  @billy was here  you re mistaken on that angle. why would you think it d be impossible for a future together  seyka s in hot water with the quen over her . . . authorized use theft  of a deceased diviners focus. if she returns to the great delta with the other quen  its very likely she s be arrested by compliance as soon as she sets foot on imperial soil again. staying with aloy in the western us would be perfectly viable as they work against nemesis. conversely  it would also be narratively possible for seyka to return to the quen and work along side alva and the new burning shores characters theo sp  and rokomo  to undermine the empire. they certainly haven t written themselves into any corners with this optional choice.
@billy was here  i like it when someone says something kind of odd and then refuses to explain it.gay sex has issues we all know it but honestly humans are already killing themselves every damn day with about everything they eat and its odd for people who preach about freedom wanting to restrict it.
@chandller burse  i never preached about freedom. and one bad thing doesn t justify another bad thing.
@billy was here  yeah but you can t control people.and it helps not being an absolute annoyance about it too
@chandller burse  well the alphabet group is doing both by forcing the subject matter where it doesn t belong  and doing it across nearly every single media entertainment conduit.
you can choose so i mean it s not as bad as some games pushing it. burning shores is a cinematic masterpiece and also i don t feel aloy is ugly either. horizon is a masterpiece of a game series imo.
from the first game through to the new dlc there has been hints  so i for one are not surprised. but she could go both ways eventually
it s generally alienating for a majority of the audience  regardless of whether they re male or female.  for straight women  it s not relatable  nor is it inclusive . for straight men  making her ugly immediately makes her less desirable to follow as a character. in addition to that though  it s similarly less relatable because she s dismissive of otherwise compelling male characters. if you had any interest in seeing aloy engage with a male love interest  that s essentially evaporated. in general  it s a silly and unnecessary choice which i m sure will influence sales. i already disliked the first game  but this makes me personally completely disinterested in the sequel.
it s sad that they re seeking to kill everything sacred and pure. it s interesting that attraction to fictional characters thing. you re gold. you help raise very real demonic signs.
i loved the first one. played it 3 times all through. i preordered the second game. just finished with this new dlc. i have to tell you the gamedesign  mission design  world building  all top notch. the big showdown at the is the best i have seen years  but this lesbian stuff at the end was unnecesary and took time from actual character building and story time. i am sp disapointed because i really loved this game. i even have aloy poster in my room
lara croft was more progressive than female characters today. she was smart  badass  and pretty. she was an actual strong  independent woman  not the woke type  and i always felt like a badass playing her character. same with blood rayne!
now aloy too!!!! just like they did with left behind dlc for the last of us. if they brought back metal gear solid imagine how woke they ll make it  anyway. great video melonie this was a good one.
aloy is one of my favorite characters  now they ve just officially mess her up  anyway  it just came to me  spoiler alert for those who haven t played forbidden west. the person aloy was cloned from aka aloy s mother  is actually a lesbian  aloy s mother was in a romantic relationship with the mane villain of the game who s a woman
without sylens  aloy is just a savage primate.now  with mr. lance passing  the horizon series  will go broke.
well fuck  just ruined one of my favorite game franchises. wow i ve only played the first one guess i m done with it now. thank you for sharing this though.your insight and honest opinions on females and the traits y all have was refreshing to hear. great channel great content keep doing what you are doing. very professional
13 00 apparently aloy let herself go between zd and fw. she lost muscles and got fatter  so while she still looks skinny she s not exactly fit or trained enough to fight mecha beasts for a living.
let me guess... that  first love interest  character is a self insert of someone  isn t it
everyone knew that something like this would be their goal since they confirmed that elizabeth  of whom eloy is a clone  was a lesbian.at the beginning of forbidden west there is a dialogue with the king of meridia in which he asks her if it is possible for her to return and be with him  there is an option to answer that maybe she will think about it after her super important mission.they also removed details like when in the first game when she came out of the water eloy delicately dried her hair.
honestly i can t get behind using typical masculine or feminine traits to dictate what characters should or should not be predisposed to do  cause otherwise a lot of these strong female characters would just be compelled to settle down  have kids and nurture a family. i just want interesting individual personalities that don t follow a set trend.
i remember aloy having one-sided flirtatious moments with 4 people in zero dawn of various genders. i do like romance in games  depending on the game   but they shouldn t do this in a dlc. have aloy develop such feelings for whoever in the 3rd game and have her act more human than  the earth is in danger i must go  to  i will save the world but i ll also have a break once in a while
i miss how gaming use to be when they didn t force a narrative or woke shit onto us!!!
i m only surprised it took sony this long implement this. guess they decided to slow walk it  while they lured fans in   got their money. frankly  i don t care because this is what i have come to expect from western entertainment now. it s why i mostly play japanese games now. it s about the only place isn t pushing this stuff constantly. at least for now.
i haven t played the dlc yet  still going through the main story but honestly i couldn t care less about her being gay  the game is hella fun and i ve been having a blast exploring the world  uncovering the lore of the old ones and i might just pick up the dlc aswell sometime. love your content though  personally i haven t noticed aloy becoming  uglier  i think she s still as cute as the previous game but that s my opinion. continue making awesome videos melonie!
remember geruila boss knew kneel cuckmann.i m betting god of war is next with loki aka atreus and i m not holding my breath for uncharted 5.
@norman readdis that explains a lot! i had no idea.
gotta make those loud 3  happy i guess lol. i played horizon with mod called aloy-face rework to make her prettier. looks like she got stung by bigger bees in forbidden west  her face swollen pretty bad lol.
@zero todona here s the sourcehttps   youtu.be pzomi_vxflsi know this will happen.
@half-vampire they thought virtue signaling means  fanservice . lol. i m not fond of nintendo as i m more of a sony guy since the ps1 but i hope they teach sony how things are done like how they re kicking disney s behind in the movie industry nowadays.
yeah was it me  or did they beat her with the ugly stick a little from first game to second
yeah  i prefer characters to look conventionally beautiful even if i m not attracted to them because i like beauty. i see no point in trying to make ugly art  it s self-defeating and utterly misconstrues the purpose of good art which is to be beautiful while expressing yourself. even wackier art pieces can be aethetically pleasing  there s a reason this stuff used to be prestigious study.i also have no more desire to watch two chicks suck face than most guys want to see dudes going at it. they should ve at least given the player different options to choose from if they were going to add a romancing element. make a mechanic out of it to incorporate into the gameplay  otherwise  what s the point  or better yet  just scrap the idea altogether and focus solely on exploration.all this to pander to a demographic that makes up less than 1  of the global population and probably isn t interested in their game anyway that is  assuming there isn t a more sinister motive by trying to brainwash people through exposure.
they made aloy unattractivewoke sjweirdos   screw the male gaze! they made aloy a lesbianwoke sjweirdos   woohoo! the gays won! us   aloy is now an unattractive lesbian. how did the gays win  how is this not misogyny
@parker brock  it s not you. i thought she looked fine in the first game. i find her face model painfully distracting in the second game. it looks like she s chewing on rocks or hiding acorns in her cheeks. it s really bizarre.
@thatharvguy  i find it funny that feminists literally scream from the rooftops that they don t need no man. they are a strong independent wamen. yet celebrate a lesbian relationship.
last good female lead i seen that was good was metriod. it was awesome. second was lara croft and tiffa and they changed them very sadly to see!
they made alloy outperform guys twice her size and ego to boot i started skipping dialogue once i started noticing the wokeness middle of game  level 39 . i just like the combat and visuals.
@goatofdeath  yeah if you look up the real-life model  she s waaaaay more attractive in real-life than how they made her look in the game. it s funny because when you compare the photogrammetry from other japanese-made games  they always make their in-game models like 1 1 to the real-life actors actresses. it s obvious the western studios make their characters ugly on purpose.
100  agreed. and from a story perspective none of this  nor tlou2  make sense. what s the point of hinging humanity s survival on characters who cannot have kids  it just makes no sense. it s a post-apoc world where humanity is on the brink  yet these characters are interested in ending their legacy s for good  all while also wiping out any way for humanity to survive  in ellite s case  no passing on her immunity to the vegetable zombies  and in aloy s case  not passing on her inherent smarts and adaptability for the next generation .
@billy was here it s why i say being gay is a luxury.
@defeatereater exactly  these games were shallow  casual garbage for the masses  has been since game one  but i played through about 30  and had my fill  like junk food everyone wants some once in a while but this stuff inspires me to erase the first game  and the free psn second game right off my hard drive
@william walton  well said.
actually it is a complete optional option in a dlc btw  nothing is preventing them to add other options in the third game  i hope they ll do or it will royally suck to have this as the only option if you want romance  which btw i was absolutely fine not having
the whole  she ugly  thing never made any sense to me. it was never a thing in hzd and she uses the same model with higher levels of fidelity and detail in in hfw  and now its a thing  lot of people just bitching for the sake of bitching . . . none of whom  i d wager  have actually played either horizon game. we saw similar moaning with aegis in steelrising too  some couldn t seem to understand the concept of art direction  that a clockpunk mechanical in a french revolution setting wouldn t look like a hyper sexualized anime android.
@goatofdeath  they did include face paint in the game for a reason...it covers the essential.
hfw already didn t sell as well as hzd apparently. the franchise is already on the decline  this will just accelerate it.
zero dawn was a nice game  but it was enough for me. didn t need a sequel or series  especially in light of the woke agenda.
they are working on a open world multiplayer version of this game next
@pegeta  multiplayer.. of course.
the game flopped anyway. it thought it could take on elden ring..... oops! just leave lara croft alone  and i won t even care about overrated crap like hzd. so long aloy. ruined her  within two games.
be hard pressed to call those  flirtatious moments  vs the social awkwardness of a teenage girl who spent her entire life isolated in the wilds with a stoic  taciturn father.
blame the left and the government
yup  used to be about having fun. but according to the leader of gaming s woke movement - neil druckmann - they don t make games to be fun.
remember learning more about the characters was reading hte manual only  not the whole life story forced into the game  good times.
this trend only just started recently. seems like gaming took the longest to integrate the wokeness
king avad definitely had a thing for aloy and she totally shrugged it off to save the world.
you know merida the irish princess is starting to look like a good template for a female character for the heroes journey
the next horizon dlc will allow aloy to grow a full beard and transition.
from what i saw in zero dawn and forbidden west it seemed like aloy and varl were getting set up to be together but then it just completely went left field and they did varl real dirty. it made me so angry with what they did and now this crap  what is wrong with these people!  i wish i could get a refund from psn for buying the dlc because i m sick of this shit.
aloy not getting any man looking like a bowl of hamburger helper  this was expected.
i ve never played any of the horizon games  but i feel like it would have been way more interesting story-wise if the love was one-sided. new character pining for aloy  but her ignoring it. that way they wouldn t have had to change her personality to suit politics. things like that have worked great in other franchises. take sonic the hedgehog  amy rose is always after him  but he never shows any interest. it makes both characters more interesting having the constant tension between them.
whelp  like tomb raider this franchise has officially become a hard pass for me. and to think  i have it on playstation and i almost purchased it again on steam as i like to support companies that do things right. i guess it is never to late to  go woke  go broke.
people were wanting romance options for her  but she could only have casual flirts. however  when the dlc rolls around she s full out l and it s not a player choice option. same thing happened for that last of us character when the dlc dropped for it.they should have given players the choice of who to romance.
crazy thing is the actress for seyka is gorgeous! they did her dirty by making her character look manly
@melonie mac go boom as someone who 100  both games and dlcs and like them  and as someone who would normally agree with you on this stuff  i think this is one of the  if not the least egregious woke thing they ve done  although it definitely was pandering and a virtue signal. the intersectionality and the toning down of aloy s looks are much more egregious not to mention making elisabet  her  mother  a lesbian with tilda  one of the antagonists in the last game. i will say  i think most comparisons of aloy in the first game vs the second are a bit misleading  since they usually take bad shots from cinematic trailers for the second game. she looks better than those shot you showed. she still looks fine to me. that s why i say toned down instead of uglified. i think the relationship between aloy and seyka was done pretty well  although i would ve liked just a little more development of the romantic feelings for each other.  i don t think it s that big of a deal   because to me  it seems like they re setting up romance options for the next game. especially since they gave us the option to accept or reject. the way they did the dialogue  they did make it cannon for her to be interested in girls  but with the flirting and avad asking her out  i think it s also cannon that she likes guys too. when she declined avad  she says she s not ready. she doesn t say she s not interested. she also reiterates this is forbidden west. if i m right and it is setting up romance options  then i don t think it s a big deal. regardless  it is a big virtue signal by doing it this way  but either way  if i m right or wrong  as long as it doesn t become her identity or a big part of the story  then it doesn t really matter to me. i don t like the idea of them adding romance options though  but that s a different conversation. also  i don t know how you can say that seyka looks like a dude. she is very attractive imo. talanah is the hottest though.
i don t mind romance in a role playing game if you can decide which romance interest the main character can pursue.  example  fem shep in mass effect choosing to be interested in liara or kaiden  but to just decide a characters gay out of the blue without any hints or player input is weird.
i agree that she looks terrible but the latest tomb raider series is really good  the first of the trilogy was a lot of fun. lara at least in that one is the most attractive version of herself in the trio  but she also is naive and easily confused by what s going on but slowly starts to uncover her limits as the island pushes her past what normal people can handle  although the whole saving her  bestfriend  was pretty weak plot wise  the 2nd game that at least improved the combat and added more stealth but the best part was that croft was stepping into the character we all know and love as the gun slinging archeologist we know but not perfect  and then the last of the tripling made her look like a bag of bricks but man was the story really good in my opinion  lara had more character depth especially since she started the apocalypse and has to resolve an aztec d-day. the coolest thing about the trilogy is that lara starts as college party girl with an interest to travel gets stuck on a haunted island and just starts merking people that captures her and her friends  slowly by the end of the first game the enemy is just running in terror of you and the things you ve done  hell cinematically  they made you frightening  my favorite scene is where she was covered in dirt and blood as she rises to the surface and steps out of the water where a helicopter crashed and is burning behind her  all the while the enemy runs in terror as they scream about her  makes you really feel her change from being the scared girl they hunted down in the middle of the night  but once she and those she saved can leave  and after the events of the island she ends up traveling more and uncovering truths after the revelations she had on that japanese island  the 2nd and 3rd game just reiterate how terrifying she is  can be and what her reputation says about her. but atleast in the 3rd she s not shoving it in my throughly about how cool she is but gave her humility instead.short version  try the tomb raider trilogy  it s surprisingly good.
the post apocalypse world would have a little more pressure on continuing the human species for one thing. for another  aloy knows there s a greater threat on the way and should be focused on that.
mio from xeno 3 is the definition of a good character with selfish motivation. to preserve her own lifespan.
there s something cute about melonie laughing at this woke bs we have nowadays
ashley burch has come out as pansexual. surely aloy could have been given just as many different opportunities - you know  given that we play the character
it s impossible to write a straight romance with how they characterized aloy. most of the men are either evil or weak  unattractive  weird  old  duty bound or combination of anything above. to write a straight romance aloy needed to be cut down a peg to show that there exists someone equal or even more powerful than her  and not evil  and it s a not a exact carbon copy of herself which seyka is. she s literally the same. romance with beta  haha  get it   would ve made much more sense  than romance with seyka. at least that way it would ve a very funny and self-indulgent in a lot ways than one romance.also aloy being gay was obvious since she was woman character after 2015  since then - every mainstream character was gay in one way or another.
i think she even implied she reciprocated  but couldn t go through with it because she had to save the world first. which yeah  that s kinda more important than starting relationships.
avad
@david conway jr. yes  she did seem to dig him. she was aggressive and he was more passive but they worked well together.
this is precisely how i thought things would end up after zero dawn s story. after the ending  and the dlc  my headcanon was that she headed back to meridian and either reconnected with avad  or erend. freaking erend  man. he was great.
hzd was one of your favorites and you haven t played hfw  you should love it. the story is worse  but it s better in every way otherwise.also  there s a somewhat convincing reason behind aloys hero complex so it isn t completely baseless.
at the end of the day  aloy is the kind of character that never needed a significant other. she is too focused on other things. she doesn t need a love interest as a character.and i will say  i am playing forbidden west currently and i don t see aloys face as fat. i think this is just some screenshots. i don t see the seyka character as manly  she is certainly more outwardly feminine than aloy. however i agree  this was a shove in. and it s a boring one
looking forward to stellar blade. please korean developers. save us!
i own the first game but didn t enjoy it. even so  i may have considered buying the second on sale just to see what it s like. like you  i m hard out now. i had this issue with miles morales as well  the game not the character . i m considering not even touching the spiderman sequel because of all the socio-political crap they shoved into miles morales. aside from pushing a particular message  it s also actively making these stories worse. they ll see how it influences sales.
just because she s gay
@defeatereater  it is a subculture of society that is actively attempting to normalize alternate sexualities or kinks. when there was a little bit  i really didn t care. but every time i turn around now it is there and they are just doing it to check boxes. that becomes annoying.the sexuality of the character typically brings nothing of value when it caters to a small group of people and alienates the majority. the only exception to this is if it plays into the fan base. like classic james bond movies having bond sleep with attractive women. even then the scenes tend to be rather short. most of the people watching bond movies are men who want to see attractive women.
@julian davis  when they start changing established characters for twitter back pats  woke points or to check boxes... i am out. don t ruin my escapism.
@wastingsanity  i agree with you 100 . kinks are being pushed on younger and younger crowds as well  and the more extreme ones keep becoming more prominent. it starts with weirdo furry bs and escalates to legitimately criminal desires which i can t really specify due to yts tos. it s abhorrent.
tr died back in 07 with anniversary and if you dont count remakes then it died with legend. ive been a huge tr fan since the first game and  minus aod  every game after anniversary shows they dont know wtf to do with her. i wish they just ended the series and it bask in its original badass glory. nothing against lesbians but lara isnt gay...in fact she doesnt even need a male love interest shes a sexy  anti hero who does whatever tf she wants. i dont even think lara ever had a hard core confirmed male love interest in the og series.
@defeatereater  what political stuff was in the miles morales spider-man game    i played all the way through and i have no clue what you re talking about
@wastingsanity  but they didn t change her. even from the first game we had no clue on which way she went. she friend zoned every guy we seen. so how and when did they change her
@fried chicken  ever since they hit her with the ugly stick  i was done with tomb raider. the cut scenes are so hard to watch knowing how she looked when they first rebooted the franchise.
@godsfavhitman  for starters there are the 2 primary radio personalities. one is very openly liberal and discusses race and gender  as well as crime and policing from a liberal perspective. i m avoiding using the term woke because it s broad  but she s talking about woke ideals in-game a majority of the time regardless. in the meantime  the other personality  jjj to be specific  is made out to be a far right commentator. he comments on things like immigration and  of course  crime. the writers try to mock one character while pushing the other as intelligent and inclusive. i ll let you guess which gets which treatment. however  a ton of that commentary was so blatant that it was immensely off-putting from both sides. sometimes i would laugh and say  but he s right though  when the writers thought they were making a funny or currently relevant social political point. besides that constant though  there are environmental design elements like graffiti and murals which are predominantly racial or openly support things like black lives matter. miles is praised at multiple points throughout the game for being  our spiderman  specifically for harlem. again  even under the suit  that s racial commentary. it s as if they re claiming peter parker spiderman  who they shouldn t even know is white  isn t there for  their community . it s contrived and it s forced  on top of being silly and immature. forgive me for being long winded but there s a lot. there is also the element of the additional characters. miles  best friend is a fat korean nerd. do with that what you will  it s not an issue it s just noticeably diverse and inclusive. phin  however  is more notable. phin is poised as an old friend who is relatable  but who is actively doing villainous things and planning to hurt innocent people because of her ideals. she s a terrorist  yet they attempt to give her a redemption arc. why  because she s a black female. instead of dedicating to her as a villain  the writers chose to point to this mean white ceo whom players essentially never interact with as the primary antagonist  lurking in the shadows. as if phin never would have chosen to be a criminal if it weren t for the rich white man. then at the conclusion  the guy is arrested on tv with little fanfare. it actively makes the plot less compelling  and the characters less relatable when these choices are so forced and blatant in their agenda. so tl dr it s everywhere. environment and character designs  character motivations and decisions  as well as a majority of the writing. i d have a harder time describing things which didn t fall under that socio-political umbrella. swinging around is fun  at least.
they change one thing and if we accept it they will change more things. next time around alloy wont be alloy its gonna be al
have you considred breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom as alternatives  very good games.
ps 4 jb system and when it comes to pc hope it gets cracked
@fried chicken  i only liked legend  anniversary and underwolrd solely for the level design and gameplay. i strongly dislike the family drama and useless npcs. nothing against the npcs directly but i just dislike that they are there often non stop throughout the level because of the bluetooth headset.
wait... what did they do to tomb raider
@lou sassole  the developers decided after they rebooted the franchise that lara croft should be less attractive. this was a time where the entertainment industry started to push the average or ugly woman look.  the tomb raider reboot in 2013 had an attractive voice actress model playing lara and the character was modeled after her. this led to a rather attractive lara croft.  the next iteration of tomb raider made a lot of fans unhappy. they took lara and threw her against the ugly tree... as she was falling  she hit every single branch.  years later i was given all the tomb raiders for free because epic just likes giving games away. i tried to play them... i couldn t make it through the cut scenes because the character was just so unattractive compared to the 2013 character.
in a real post apocalypse world  women in general would have a much different role. and not a good role. no time to argue about feminism and empowerment in a world where everything is chaos. the truth is far too brutal to be shown properly in a video game without it immediately being labeled as mature  or completely banned outright.
@stankey poosea  in a post apocalyptic world it would be either savagery or order.maybe peaceful societies would exist after some time.but in all honesty this being a point you use isn t that good since all it implies is that humans are just awful when left without the order they also despise.
at least the xenoblade chronicles franchise has a lot of strong attractive female characters in each game.
it gets real old getting beat over the head with the strong independent wahman agenda driven stuff.
it s selfish but reasonable  mio wants to live longer than the endless now allows her too and man  i really love mioshe s also adorable with noah if you ignore n that went full anakin skywalker  but our noah thankfully didn t went crazy like him .i m hyped for the future redeemed dlc but i m worried with woke bs even on xenoblade  especially because people are theorizing that a might be non binary a genderless computer since a is probably alvis and they are avoiding giving pronouns to apersonally  in lore  i don t have issues with it since alvis is a machine and all  but it will get really annoying in the fandom  whatever someone calls a a   she  someone will reply with   they  and this will rise a series of meaningless discourses.honestly i really wish they don t do it  but regardless of that i think that the dlc will be great  i m just talking more than i should about it because i found someone talking about xenoblade here
@safer ren  i buy into alvis creating a new personality compared to gender swapped alvis.
@kevin ramirez  taikishia can write damn good characters.
@safer ren  i have faith in takishia. he has a long term story for the franchise. i can not wait  for the next chapter of mio s story trying to reunite with noah and selfish motivation again to make contact with bionis. it has to be a stop gap game while rejoining diemensions will be 4.
@the fastest hedgehog  i feel like future redeemed will end showing the mio s perspective of the base game s post credits scene  then this will be where xc4 begins with the story being about noah and mio seeking to reunite both worlds properly
@safer ren  i think they will do another spinoff before 4 because they found a good release formula. i think mio and her father trying to re establish contact with bionis could be the next game or the inevitable warriors.
@safer ren  i do agree about the post credit scene
@the fastest hedgehog  hello man  i already have anwsers regarding a spoiler alert come back once you reach it .alvis is ontos and a is alvis. pneuma   femalelogos   maleontos   both at the same time. but a calls ontos a  he  afther this is stated so the guy alvis is still a man but a is technically both at the same time since it s alvis with a female body.i just wish the woke mob doesn t take a as their token character  because i found the concept very cool
@safer ren  you know they will. if they have an oppertunity they will  which means if nintendo actually look at online discourse they will walk this back.
i don t think she has a fat face either  kinda chubby  either way i love her facial features. that aside  i don t necessarily care that she interested in women because so was elizabet and aloy has almost 100  of her dna and i thought about this too that  even though you having been almost identical to the chromosome as someone else might not necessarily mean you ll have the same sexual interest as them  like with our own technology today  but with the highly advanced technology they have in the game  i guess it s certainly possible. then i thought  damn  elisabet is almost a dick for putting that on her clone and not exactly giving her autonomy by her being just like her. that s not exactly the case  but you know what i mean. hopefully. other than that  sorry this is so long  i didn t really care about her being gay. it wasnt forced on the player and most certainly wasnt harped on throughout the game. that s at least a plus.
wasn t expecting to see you here.
@chefboi  ardeeznutz   i do think it s kind of a cop out that both would be lesbian simply because they share the same genetic code. aloy always came off as a smart ass who naturally charmed people no matter who. caring deeply  but never in a romantic way about everyone she met. only a select few seemed to even get close. but her goal was always  i gotta fix everything so the world doesn t fall apart. i admit she seemed hurt when varl started showing emotions for zo  but again  that was it. she just never needed romance. and that is coming from a romance nut. she is better off being the stoic type in terms of romance. she can worry about the dating when her task is finally completed.i wish they had focused more on what they are gonna do about sylenz now that the actor has passed away
@thescyy  no one ever does  i m all over these internets
@starsan  absolutely  been watching your stuff on and off since i saw you on alan roberts way back.
@thescyy  thank you  i m trying to get the message out man  let me tell you
@starsan  yeah i can see what you mean  at the very least it shouldn t have went so fast where they clearly had feelings for each other  instead maybe do that in the next game near the end.
@chefboi  ardeeznutz   it was forced on the player  though  you don t have a choice to not make aloy gay.
@billy was here  that s not exactly what i meant though. i meant forced as in being mention every other mission. as if it s some integral aspect of her as a character.
agreed.   she was just fine just being friends with other people.
this is actually good news for me  another game i can scratch off my list. one step closer to elden ring
im glad you covered this  i will not be getting the dlc. can i just play something without this being crammed down my throat
i never thought errand was aloy s type.  at the same time  a more worthy male counterpart for aloy might have potentially overshadowed her a bit.  one that was slightly beneath her in ability would have made it awkward.media doesn t know how to present proper heterosexual relationships with powerful women anymore.  they seem afraid of the old message taking over.  it was a good message - both messages can exist  you know.still  you call aloy beautiful and in the thumbnail you call them ugly
gaming should be an escape into fantasy for people but people like to bring their life issues into the games themselves nowadays.
have yet to play the 2nd horizon game as i don t own a ps5 yet  but i really liked the aloy-erend ship they seemed to be setting up in the first game. guess that didn t come to fruition in the sequel  and now this in the dlc. pretty good reason for me to skip the sequel entirely.
i know she s just a character but i m glad aloy is happy that she found someone and is not alone anymore idk i didn t give a shit that it was another woman. that s just my opinion though and everyone s entitled to their own opinion. the dlc was fun.
sony has gone full woke and full ubisoft too.they hinted at a potential relationship with erend and avad and now they do a typical woke 180  and do this woke panderind.i agree with the switch of aloy s personality to a typical perfect strong unstopabble character mary sue rey palpatine copy and paste .they even wokeified her  removing most of her beauty because of the  male gaze  in favor of woke activists on twitter and fake game  journalists  who do not even play the game.sony already emasculated kratos in ragnarok  and now aloy is an ugly woke lesbian  and i can guarantee that they will kill off the male characters in her crew or make them gay.horizon zero dawn never deserved a sequel  it  stood on it s own  and for me that is the only game to play and enjoy.
i m so annoyed by it. i stopped playing the game. . it s like why does every game need to make a  woke statement ... everything was going just fine with her having no love interest.. now all of a sudden  out of nowhere  were supposed to believe she all of a sudden has this  interest  in intimacy
i still want aloy and avad to be a couple!  now that would have been amazing.
aloy in the dlc has a covid lockdown feel
it has happened too many times for it to be a coincidence  but sony seems to make their characters lesbians in dlc and not full releases. there was the uncharted spinoff that was kinda dlc but also it s own thing that had its two female leads that apparently had romantic relationship forming but i can t say since i haven t played it myself. then there was the last of us dlc that made ellie a lesbian when in the main game she that didn t really come up at all with only mentions of a female friend that could have just been a female friend. now  there is this dlc. i would guess that sony doesn t believe these characters would sell if people knew they were lesbian in the first place and they would rather add that characteristic later in the dlc that many people will probably ignore.
who the hell cares that she s attracted to women and why does it bother you so much  aloy never even hinted that she liked men anyway  so it s not like it was a pre established character like lara to  suddenly go woke  out of nowhere  i know that there s a woke agenda behind a lot of games these days and it s really annoying to see it everywhere  but i feel that this just wasn t an example of that
i don t find aloy  uglier   i remember people being up in arms because she has chubbier cheeks  but outside of that  tbh she looks so good in forbidden west. she has slightly chubby cheeks in the first game but i feel with the tech they used for face realism it kinda made them more pronounced but yea idk she looks fine  but i understand the frustrations behind making her lesbian or bisexual in the least. personally she seems more unaffected by romantic relationships and doesn t want to pursue anyone  that s the only reason this felt shoehorned.
imagine being offended about a kissing scene between 2 female characters  that lasts 10 seconds and where you have the choice to say  yes  or  no  . poor little fragile manchildren. i agree with many things on this channel  but i am not an npc who automatically approves 100  of what she says on this channel. but for sure 4 h of playtime  is not enough in order to build a good relationship between 2 characters  so it this feels a little bit rushed. i would have prefered to see their relationship develop in 1 full game  not in a dlc.
i m only surprised it took them that long to do this.nowadays you can only have men as main leads or men with boobs as geeky from clownfish would put it.
after taking down so many mechanical dinosaur menaces she falls prey to the most deadly of them all. the lickolottapus.
you make a very valid point. whatever they are doing these days it is lazy and is ruining everything.
i suggest a game that youve never heard of that never  and streamers will never play this game  got a sequal with a badass female lead. her quest is to discover more about her family and that shes part of a half-demon family. the game is called   primal   for the ps2. jennifer tate is the character and primal is amazingly beautiful and under rated settings. if you want to bring more ppl to better characters  stream primal.
i think people wanting to be a hero or save the world is a human think  comes from the heart not the genetics  men just typically look better doing it cause muscles lmao  i feel like people need to stop blurring the lines between real life and video games movies they dont have to line up with how real life is  thats kinda the point of a game is because its not real life  but thats just how i see it
they had years to do this  plenty of characters to do it with  yet they did it now with a character from a dlc that isn t even part of the main storyline  this feels to me like a last minute change  probably someone from sony said they weren t checking enough boxes so they has to do this.
yup  i was waiting for dlc to drop to play the game.  but i guess it s a passed for me now.  there are other games that is worth my time.
since this is associated with the dlc  of which isn t available on ps4  i will finish out my playthrough of forbidden west and say goodbye to the series once and for all. first they messed up her face  then added some weird space stuff  and now this forced obligatory relationship  no thanks.
what a reason lmao  do as you wish  i just think it s a bit silly to give an entire game your seal of dissaproval just because your ship didn t end up coming true
@g3ar  it s not so much that the ship i wanted didn t happen  i m used to that happening in shows and movies and games  it s disappointing but won t make me quit. what makes me want to skip the sequel now is the fact that sony decided to make both of their female leads lgbt. they already had ellie from tlou as a lesbian  but aloy had been set up as at least having some level of interest in men in the first game  and it seemed like we were going to get a straight female lead in a aaa game  something that feels surprisingly rare these days. instead they have either made her lesbian  or at least bisexual now. it s like sony refuses to have a straight female lead. i ve always wanted a new uncharted trilogy  focused on the daughter from uncharted 4 s epilogue  cassie  but now i fear sony would just make her lgbt as well. modern wokeness sucks.
first game were created before sony turned woke. if i m not wrong  dev started create game in 2014 which is before woke era. second game is produced right after the first game released  in 2018 when sony became woke with their movies
@shikamaru317  is ellie and aloy their only female leads my lord their library is smaller nowadays than ever.they really need to revive the series from ps2
@bobo boy  people say the woke era started in 2010 dude.no one has a consistent say on this crap
@chandller burse  i play game back then and watching movies too. yes some games and movies back then has woke element like feminism and hinted homosexual but it never full woke agenda. i would say the full woke era started in hollywood back in 2013 with netflix and then it creeping into blockbuster movies in 2016. while for games  it s started in 2013 with last of us and then it goes full woke in 2017 with mass effect. and before you think why it became woke  you should read about fourth wave feminism which born in 2014 and every feminist in hollywood embrace that new wave in 2015 when same gender marriage is permissible in us. swap race already exist as old as hollywood  it just recently jews elitist in hollywood swap white character into black for social point among woke supporterin every decision  there s always jews elitist who running the whole agenda. as a muslim  i remember with  war against terror  and that agenda running from 2002 to 2015. today it s replaced by woke agenda. in future  they might create a new term for running new agenda
@bobo boy  the last of us 1 wasn t woke as far i saw.andromeda was andromeda it was more broken than woke.
@bobo boy  as a muslim you should know what its damn like to be blamed for so much you didn t do.your discrimination of jews isn t much different than a white man yelling about  those arabs
@chandller burse  they have the female main character of returnal  assuming it becomes a major ip for them and gets a sequel. off the top of my head i m not thinking of any other female leads in their current slate. god of war male  spider-man male  ratchet   clank male  ghost of tsushima male  etc.
ellie in the first game had a naked man mag too joel takes away.
the uncharted lost legacy dlc isn t like that. they aren t forming a relationship  they just bond as adventurers. it s actually pretty refreshing. you should play it  it s a great followup to uncharted 4.
@lou sassole  i did get that vibe they were hinting at it in the dlc  but you re right that it wasn t mde explicit in lost legacy. however  the devs couldn t help themselves and posted up some woke fan art depicting the two charactrs in a relationship.
@billy was here  ohhhh that s right  i forgot about that. at least it s easy to miss haha and not actually in the game. but it sure doesn t make me wanna see them put out any future games  at least not with nadine and chloe
@billy was here  there  was nothing depicting a relationship  nothing
agreed.
uh  have you seen the real life model she s based on  they made her head way larger in the game and expanded her jawline and cheeks. look up the comparison between the two. photogrammetry doesn t do that on its own  it s tech agnostic  it only scans what s in front of it. the artists widened her head.
@billy was here it happens in all games.  they don t usually make their characters 1 1 like the models.  jedi fallen order is a good example.  beauty is also subjective.
@slander pop  in western games and for attractive females  it s usually not 1 1 at all. for the male characters  usually yes  i.e.  mass effect andromeda and calisto protocol . in eastern games  they re almost always 1 1  such as yakuza  judgment  and that upcoming project m  i think it s called
im think aloy rejecting seyka fits her more  king avad is def main love interest of aloy
wow im still playing through the dlc  i somehow had a feeling this was going to happen  and boom  it happened smh
notice how they always do these coming outs in dlcs expansions.
omg and horizon series has been my personal escapism.. so figures
same as you  i played the first release of this game when it came out. it was awesome. i still haven t played the expansions etc as well.  i don t understand why female badasses need to be gay to be a badass.
they should ask kevin de bruyne to play her in the live-action movie
i agree with certain things you are saying. however aloy does not look like the thumbnails famous  fat aloy face  she s actually even more beautiful than in zero dawn. her face used to be all plasticky
you can t have people who are activists above all else in charge of anything and think this won t be the outcome.
when they made her look like aloy avocado  they lost a ton of interest. how cool would it have been to make her a futuristic lara though  exploring the tombs of our society.
i m glad biff tannen finally found love
i dunno  when it comes to games the issue has a bit of a different root than just the  woke  trend i m afraid. back in the 80 s and 90 s almost all video game protagonists were male  that situation have just simply evolved into having a larger selection of female characters that are either bi or lesbian - because although male players may not mind playing as a hot woman  they do not like having their character getting intimate with a guy. samus aran  the protagonist of the metroid franchise and the first female human protagonist in videogames  remains straight to this day however  but that s nintendo for you - they always do their own thing.
so sad to see this series go this way  i loved the first game and the dlc with it  couldn t get into the second and have no interest to get this dlc.
at least they could ve given aloy a hog nose. i m shaking that they haven t done this.
cool  was on the fence about buying this and now the decision is easy.
this is precisely why i m collecting retro games. one of my all-time fav game companies  capcom  just released the sf6 showcase  and it was a woke disaster. it gave me even more motivation to finish my collection before it s too late. i am just unbelievably tired of socio-political crap in my entertainment  and i do not want my kids to experience it either.
the reason i buy dlcs is because it adds more maps  enemies  weapons armor  and quests. those things give the games more replay value. not just a lesbian relationship... and if a romantic relationship is important  then let the gamers choose!
i know why i don t invest in this franchise. and probably never will. and i m not alone with this. i rather walk around in the landscape with a bb and carry out deliveries all by myself.
that s what i did in the dlc when they gave you the choice. i just rejected her.
facts.... just like last of us
i think that helps with certain countries that don t allow such content. they can still sell the game and make money on the game  but they simply don t offer the dlc there  and all is fine.
@j rilla  it s an almost ten year dlc and it was done naturally.
she didn t get a fatter face she just got stung by a bee or mech equivalent.
wow  it never ends.
if a girl wants to kiss a girl i don t see a problem with it
i m gonna have a hard time playing without being able to see aloy abs  i know that much lol!
@melonie mac go boom  apparently i edited right as you liked the comment  lol. also aaaaaabbbbbssss.
it really put a damper on my enthusiasm for the game. that and the silly plot in  forbidden west .  i really like the idea of  aloy tomb raider  searching the ruins of old earth for tech needed to keep the world going.
it s why i play elden ring and final fantasy and some indie games like the first hades and stray. because the degree of wokeness  absolute zero. the upcoming final fantasy xvi s director s response to backlash of there being no black people in the game trailer was   this is based on european medieval myth.  and miyazaki s response to people calling elden ring character customization lacking in diversity and the game lacking  accessibility options  is   that s how our games are.  can bill maher get these two cojones awards please
i hate wokeness i really do but how was street fighter 6 showcase was woke
@fear_the_nog  and because of that  i ll buy ff16. i admire his big balls response. also nier automata director s response to a journalist in regards to his love for sexy ladies in vgas and how people need to deal with it.
@maverick  did you not notice zangief being destroyed by the giant snu snu amazonian woman and the announcer being literally chris tucker from the fifth element  if that is not a giant red flag to you  then idk what will.
@mad dog gamer  eh. i seen worse wokeness in other media. because zangief and the amazon woman fighting is what street fighter is. if chun li was fighting ryu would that be wokeness  but the announcer tho is what your right about. but that s 1 thing. at least it s not like they are turning chun li lesbian or sakura transgender
@maverick  sf is supposed to be a hyper masculine fighting game. if they want overwatch looking characters in it  then they can create their own new franchise with these checking boxes characters. some franchises cater more to a men audience and there is nothing wrong with that. just stop inserting fruity looking men and androgenous women in these long existing franchises that are all about muscular men and curvaceous women fighting.
@mad dog gamer  that still doesn t explain about zangief and the amazon woman fighting. like i said your right about the announcer guy. but that was one thing  at they aren t turning straight characters gay or something but nothing against zangief and the woman fighting was woke
@mad dog gamer  muscular men and curvaceous women - that s actually how every man and every woman were carved by ancient greeks and romans. kinda ironic.
how exactly is sf6 woke
@fear_the_nog  ff has gay characters
this is the way
@gloria thomas  gay and woke don t mean the same thing tho. just like having strong female protagonists don t mean something is woke  aliens  terminator  i m looking at you . it s how they do it and there s got to be this one sided message and the message always uses the same exact words like it came out of the same pamphlet. woke to me  is like if fundamentalist christians made movies and randomly inserted sermons into them  only it s leftism instead of jesus.
@fear_the_nog  the way i describe woke messaging is with this comparison. imagine you re watching a movie in the cinema that you paid a lot of money to watch with your family. then  in the middle of the movie  a scene starts  which has the main character lift up a hershey chocolate bar in his hand and starts telling you how delicious it is and to not forget to grab one at the concession bar. it would be insulting to you  the paying customer  how a multi-billion dollar corporation inserted an uncalled for message to buy their product  which ruins the immersion of the movie. this is how i see wokeness  an uncalled for messaging of a product that no one asked for.
@maverick  the announcer is made to be a transformer  they have inserted a lot of fruity elements  such as the effeminate background dancers   they removed the labels of  male  and  female  in the character creator  and have gone all-in on trying to appeal to people who obsess over pronouns. it is woke.
@fear_the_nog  unfortunatly ff7 got cursed though. especially tifa got light beatings with the ugly stick. light because she still looks like an attractive woman for the moment.
love emulation.that s all i ve been doing. emulation and playing my older games.i have a backlog big enough to ignore all modern games if it comes to that. and im not alone.modern gaming is in a steady decline  despite the quality of graphics skyrocketing in the past 5 years.
@billy was here  like i said. he s right about the announcer guy being trans and didn t elden ring removed the male and female option and woke people still hate the game  and us normal people still like elden ring  like the guy on top said. it s woke when the message they are trying to tell is forceful and such. like i said. at least they aren t pandering mostly to the left and turning straight characters gay
@maverick  oh i absolutely avoided elden ring chiefly because of that. people keep saying  oh it s just x  or  oh it s just x and now y....  and that just keeps escalating. capcom doing the whole drag queen stream for sfvi should have been the nail in the box for most people  yet people still keep defending it. and don t count out that they will turn a straight character gay. big companies are notorious for doing that  and capcom will likely do it via some surprise dlc or side-quest story in sfvi.
@billy was here  so you avoided elden ring just over that 1 little thing  you know woke people hated the game right  and non woke people loved the game. plus in japan it was male and female but changed it in the west because of how the west are. and plus capcom doing drag queen stream  let me ask you something. was that capcom japan or was that capcom america who is known for that stuff like that like firing the og voice actor for ken for being a trump supporter. because capcom japan is the original company while capcom america and such are not. and i m sure they won t do that because capcom haven t done that to any of their characters. hell there was a character that people said were trans but the creator said that her gender is ambiguous and it s our decision to decide what she is and he even said to him she s a woman like a full blown woman. like she was born female
@maverick  sorry  but that s a whole lot of cope. if the infestation is already there at capcom  it s just a matter of time before it spreads even more like it did with square  atlus  and arc system works. and as for elden ring it wasn t one little thing  it s the fact that they are literally denying basic reality and asking other people to deny it as well. that s a pretty huge thing and sets a really bad precedent.as for wokies disliking it  well  they also disliked hogwarts legacy  and that has a ton of pro-woke stuff in it. there s just no pleasing that crowd.
@mad dog gamer  aren t all women in st series always been amazonian looking
@mad dog gamer  the women in sf to me have always looked that way dude.and i ve never played these games lol
@blackcroft666lp  tifa literally looks the same they just made her less busty and suddenly she s ugly lol thats so dumb
aloy better be careful or she ll wake up with burning sores.
it should have been a choice basd on player s interactions with the npc not a forced out of nowhere bs like that.the only thing i didn t like about the protagonist here how she had 0 real  meaningful connections to anyone  but i crosssed that on the list of  in love with the mission . when i wished for connections  this is not what i was looking for.
they did the  hero complex  thing on hitman too  turned 47 into an assassin for the people. i never did like that.
is it just me or did aloy gain about 20 pounds since the last game
tell me what the heck happened to aloy s face that looks stung like a bee  she is super athletic and in shape that most can only dream of yet she has the face of a 300lb plus woman.
i mean... you take 1 look at aloy and you know she s a carpet cleaner.
aloy was an insane mountain climber  how tf do you take away her abs  she should look like magnus mitbo
you know  i m thinking about how genshin impact completely made aloy cute
thank you for making great content!
must admit im not really bothered about horizon  played the first but all the woke messaging in it made my eyes roll so damn much it became a slog which was a pity  the game had great potential and aloy could have been on par with lara  but they screwed the support npc s and the story messaging. never bothered with the sequel as i saw exactly where it was going and had no interest
in the 2nd game they insinuated that the person she was cloned from is lesbian and she was rejecting the king of carja advances!i played both games and aloy really not a likable character  the world and monster what brings back but i don t know if i ll play the third especially after the disappointing story of the second and the gameplay that didn t bring really news changes  it seems they kept the cool things for the dlc
we all should have seen this coming.
they re trying to have their cake and eat it too. there was already something between her and erend  and varl as well. they just never acted on it. and now  for the woke points  they commit to her liking women. i ll guarantee you if there were enough backlash to this  which i d be shocked if there were  too many gamers are all  yass queen!  about this stuff  guerilla would simply say   oh  she s bi  of course she likes these guys too.  it s the weakest commitment they can make that gives them an easy out. i almost wish they would just be clear about it from the beginning rather than this wishy washy stuff.
to be honest  any sort of love interest for aloy was random. she just met seyka  how do you instantly realize you have feelings for someone after a few hours of meeting them  weren t they just fighting in the middle of the dlc  lol made no sense whatsoever  gay or straight.
ya know if this had happened in the 90 s it would have been shot down as a teenage boy s fantasy.  i know the  knight in shining armor saving the princess  is trite and  out of touch   but can you think of a game in the past decade that scratched that itch
i was gonna pickup this dlc but don t think i will now.
i have been curious about your ending song  is that pillar  the last album of theirs i got was the one after where do we go from here  i do not remember the name   so i am not sure.i figure even if i am wrong  you probably know which band i am talking about since you are a christian around the same age as me.
errand is the big brother type or friendzone type.
i mean i wouldn t say aloy was ever beautiful  deliberately so on the developer s part...  but i get where you re coming from melonie. i always thought the game was leaned woke. i am not surprised they went all the way. lol.
never played horizon but i did see a review for burning shores and as soon as the reviewer mentioned alloys new companion i immediately thought to myself  they re going to make them gay aren t they   literally saw it coming from a mile away and i never even touched these games
exactly what i was thinking.here you have aloy being a fantastic  strong and agile athlete  able to climb and jump all sorts of obstacles and now she suddenly has gotten a fatter face and lost her muscles.
yeah most likely they ll argue she s bi. mindy kaling literally did this exact same thing with velma. making a character bi is the easy way out of adding  sexual diversity  while still committing to heterosexual relations anyway  because they want woke points  but also realize  95  of people in the world aren t interested in same sex relations  even if they re  accepting  of them .
@david conway jr. actually yes they are look it up because they wouldn t do this stuff because more people don t like it but more people do like it
@random reactions tv  no they arent
@krafterzdavid  yes they are i don t talk with out doing research i love a good debate in i like proving homophobes wrong
fallout 4 did this the right way in 2015. why can t it be like that almost a decade later
looks like horizon the woke west is at it again. i agree with you. i loved zero dawn... probably one of my favorite ps4 games. but it was a different time back when that one came out like 6 years ago... this one and even the dlc expansion have come across as a list of checkboxes they needed to make for a small percentage of people who probably don t even play these kind of games. this just spells fucking yikes and has it written all over.
so much for telling the king she saved that she d be back for him .two timing or what and what about erand who obviously had a crush on her from the start
usually this is done when a tv shows ratings are falling like a rock or sales of a video game series are in the toilet. of course it s done for more or less voyeuristic reasons to try and improve those ratings or sales. if it does work at all it s usually short lived and then things go further down the drain. i would be willing to bet this doesn t work in the long run. instead of thinking that maybe  just maybe  the studio needs to improve their product they will just call gamers  ...ists.
aloy s gay by the way.  -- the critical doggo s human caregiver and publicist
listen i dont care too much about her sexuality but ffs whats up with the trend of making female protagonists in a post-apocalyptic setting lesbian  its becoming a clich .
at least they give the option to reject the relationship offer. they knew forcing it would weird many players out. there was zero chemistry between them in the first place making it a weak attempt at this woke crap.
we are all living in a post apocalyptic world now.
guerrilla  we re proud to reveal that aloy is a lesbianliterally everyone  we know
the first game wasn t perfect  but it was fun and i got the platinum trophy for it i liked it so much  played for around 80 hours . i put the sequel down after less than 15 hours. the dialogue and characters are just written so poorly. they really had to go and make it worse.
i just compared aloy from the first game to aloy burning shores. they totally butched her up. wow messed up!!!
just about the only character that wasn t beaten with the ugly stick in the first game was the blacksmith chick who loves explosions.
ironically  they didn t give her a hero complex on the forbidden west.  she is literally trying to save the world and is the only one who can because of her dna.  she is comes across as kinda weary of playing the hero actually  but unable to stop due the whole destruction of the world thing.but it is telling of the creators mindset that all most every female lead is either ridiculously  unrealisticly over sexualized  i.e. bayonetta  or a lesbian.  i guess they figure serious straight women can t be heros.
ellie  now aloy. both in a world that needs repopulation... lmao
you knew they were going to dothis.it was waiting in the shadows.
this is why i stopped playing the  latest games. tired of the wokeness invading the gaming industry and shoving it down our throats. also another reason why i still play skyrim
i m a huge fan of you. godbless and godspeed.
you hit the nail on the head about them waiting till dlc to do this!
it s like a one minute scene in a massive game  and totally up to you if you want to engage so it s an optional kiss  nothing more. hearing you say you never played it makes me kinda sad  there s never been any mention of her sexuality in either game  regardless if you think she had a flirty thing going on in the 1st game. it s not like the dlc is about her finding her sexuality  it s all over and done in less than a few seconds geez
woke is really blind and depraved. it s turning people s sins into their identities making it so much harder to repent of those sins
well i guess it s up to rule34 modders to do god s work and clean up after this mess  again.
its because they do it in every world  even in one s where it makes no sense whatsoever. when you re in a post-apocalyptic setting  the first priority should be repopulation over anything else. it just shows how self-centered modern society is.
this i agree with. i just chose the fist option and rejected it. the series itself is fun and i enjoy learning the lore too.
i have no problem with the girl romance as much as the narrative driving it. i used to play dragon age and have my character mess around with both girls and guys and it was fun funny  this horizon feels contrived and forced. they started the narrative by changing her entire appearance to someone who looks like an ugly cousin of hers with some massive wisdom tooth removal level cheeks jowls and a strange pointy forehead  it gives uncanny valley vibes  that is usually a face model for someone grossly overweight not someone living off the land and constantly moving. she also changed within 6 months or so of the time of the events of the previous game. her personality has become unnecessarily aggressive  due to prior events  trauma  maybe  but let s be real it is just narrative conforming to be  strongk    whereas she was previously assertive and actually strong in hozd by contrast. instead of building her character they make her a poster child caricature to the point where her genshin impact counter part has more personality. ironically the second game removed a lot of the choice options they had in the first game with maybe 3-4 of the dialogue choices at the start of the game  essentially taking away her and the player s agency . while the carja and osseram vs indigenous western tribes fit a narrative according to the story  that colonialism theme definitely was intentional as well. every leader or strong person seems to be predominantly female to the point of 99  predictability. as i was playing  she began feeling more and more like a rey palpatine than her own oc.  and again to the original point of her being unattractive  why not be attractive  not bc she is a woman in a game but bc mostly characters in these genres typically are  dante  kratos  link  alexios  ezio any of the ac characters besides cassandra who is meh looks wise but passable   dragon age characters  etc. making her ugly and unappealing bc she is a female mc is the actual misogyny
crying for avad
still haven t played forbidden west  now dunno if i should. wokeness ruins everything. maybe i ll just catch up on the retro stuff   you look gorgeous today  melonie
in forbidden west  tilda tells aloy that her and elisabet  aloy beta cloned  were in love  but elisabet was too involved in her work and the relationship suffered. it was a major story point if you paid attention. so  i m guessing beta is also lesbian.
shame  i actually enjoyed forbidden west  but if this is the way they re going to treat the franchise  i can easily find something else to spend my money on.
i bought the second game on sale and have yet to play it because so many other games are occupying my interest with more to come on the horizon soon...
aloy looses her father figure rost in hzd and then in the next game proceeds to go into fatherless behavior lmao
good video  keep up the good work..!!
aloy being a lesbian honestly doesn t surprise me. i fully expected them to do this after the end of the first game. i actually would ve prefered if aloy remained single. not every heroine needs a love interest.
i think the default in gaming love interest ehould ether be straight or player choice especially in games during apocalyptic events or if its a tribal etc type culture where such things were less common both just cause group survival instincts and it wasnt a trendy character trait and many characters that are ether canonical straight or very strong hints of being straight keep changing them to same sex or bi its obvious someone putting their kinks into the character weather they are that or not and agree with a pure action game love interest shouldnt be that big a aspect of the game ugly girls shouldnt be main characters or protagonists or ally charactersplus with aloy who had a actual human model who looked waaay different then at least the 2nd version and looked fairly good but the 2nd game chwnged that which i think was somewhat a insuilt to a rl womanits quite bad how they keep making ugly female characters and or mwking all of them lesbianslike i would be more neutral on lesbian woman gay guys if it wwsnt shoved on my face all the time and forced character changes towards that direction
i just noticed they made aloy s face look like nicado avacado and i cannot un-see that.
there are two types of peoplethose who appreciate eye candythose who have no idea wtf eye candy is but yet throw a fit when they see it  question it  and despite any answer still want to cancel it.
tbf aloy in forbidden west only sets off to save everything as she knows a apocalypse is coming and that she is the only person who can get past the ancient facilities gene locks due to her being a clone.overall game was fun but original much better.will say it strange that everyone is moaning of starving from a famine yet every other character has 3 chins on forbidden west
i want to find someone that talks about me the way melanie talks about abs...
full disclosure... im as anti woke as you can be.... except for one cross dressing dude... and basicly every important character being gay  and all the strongest characters being women...its not bad... im aware of what im saying.. the gameplay is nice.. the graphic is outstanding... the story is... well honestly kinda meh... but if you enjoyed zero dawn  you are probably gonna like forbidden west. having said that.. since wokeness only ever gets worse and never better.. im definetly not playing the dlc or next game.this isnt last of us 2 pushing nothing but the woke agenda... forbidden west is genuinely enjoyable despite the woke stuff.also its free on psn... so... no risk incase you dont like it.edit. oh and her face looks super mega obese from certain angles... wtf did they do lol.
one of the best looking games with decent gamplay. however the plot and character writing is meh.
i painfully agree with you
but its a boring game with nothing new the plot is so predictable and boring...its not even worth it at all resident evil 4 is better in my view...
@knlght0fzero  there is also a side quest with a lady complaining that she couldn t get into a blacksmith guild because she s a woman  but i agree the game doesn t have a lot of woke stuff in the game. i second your review  if people enjoyed zero dawn  this game is a solid sequel. i would even say i think the game does a pretty good job giving aloy character development  especially after a certain scene during the mid point of the game.
i d stay away from it at this point
@cary malone  see  that quest i considered pretty reasonable... of course these primitive tribes wouldnt let a woman blacksmith... that makes more sense than most of the woke stuff... granted  pretty sure thats not the reaction the developers wanted from players.... they probably expected something like  those mysoginistic tribes  pff a woman can do anything .boy counting all the woke stuff  its quite alot huh.. nothing extreme.. just alot... lol... games still fun to play though...
retro never fails. ten times better than current.
@knlght0fzero  oh for sure the game has plenty of stuff i can quibble with but i still enjoyed the game. btw r.i.p. sylens lance reddick
i was thinking  about picking up the game however  i am having second thoughts.
hey melonie  love your content and views on the topics you cover. as an avid og tomb raider fan myself i also believe lara croft is an anti hero with questionable ethics when searching for treasures and saving the world as a last resort i still imagine how beautiful and streamlined the remakes of the first 4 games could be if the dev company really cared about us true fans and legacy of eidos...
all she needs is a subaru forester and a utility belt!
i wanted to play the first one... now i might have to avoid it altogether for the wokeness.also have these people not seen real life couples  plenty of men will still x-ualize aloy and the les scene.
if i m not mistaken  dartigan from gaming sins called it her being attracted to the same sex some time ago
thanks for bringing this to light!... not playing it now.
because of this i think i ll stick with genshin s aloy  waifu version . good thing for me is that i didn t play horizon series despite the first game said it was good but they chose to go the last of us dlc route.
is heterosexuality even portrayed anywhere anymore
@backintime alwyn genshin maybe  the creators are from china so let people do whatever they want so they don t cheese off the ccp. genshin is a straight game but there s no real romance  let s put it this way  they say the brother is the main character but the pc is totally lumine.
being a hero can be a journey of loneliness as well. some heroes have no time to fall for someone or the hero is afraid of getting close to anyone for the loss would be heavy. so most heroes i d prefer them to be alone as well.
i smell the stench since the beginning when the horizon boss new kneel cuckman and was together in an interview. there s a reason fate didn t lete buy the game. i was about buy it since 2015 e3 but i prioritize better games that time abs was busy. now i regret nothing.
@moe s gaming  go play ffxiii then  there s three games and the beautiful main female protagonist doesn t get with anyone at the end. i guarantee that there is content out there for you to project yourself onto.
@petrichor  my friend that goes for any hero. i play the yakuza series where kiryu has no love interest. the only woman he ever loved died in his arms and he couldn t have any luck since. the life he leads only ends up with someone he cares for hurt or killed. i may get ff13 one day but it didn t catch my interest
you fully expected it  my headcanon was that after she was done exploring after the end of zero dawn  she went back to meridian to reconnected with sun king avad. it was the only outcome that logically made sense with the way things went. consider their interaction right before the final battle.
@lou sassole  what i mean is i completely expected for the game devs to go woke and make aloy an ugly lesbian.
@armand vega  oh yeah  i see what you mean. cuz everything goes that way these days  sadly
@backintime alwyn  western media  no idea. but japan delivers. also far better developed same sex relationships with actually attractive characters. ugly sticks solely for comedy or....certain adult media ...
it s like say you re jealous without saying you re jealous.
tomb raider anniversary has aged incredibly well. i always wanted to see 2  3 and tlr get the same treatment.
@lou sassole  not character or storywise though. but the gameplay and graphics are ok.
@lou sassole  yes i still have my copy of tr anniversary and it still plays looks great
they ruined my whole thing i had planned for her in my mind  she was gonna be sun queen after my adventures i ll settle down as queen not anymore apparently.
no time for love  dr. jones. gotta save the world!
another great video  they nerfed her abs put that on a t shirt lol
the woman she was cloned from was literally a lesbian  i think i m the only one who kinda saw this coming. but i never thought it would happen after she meeting a random chick in the dlc  i thought she d be sexually attracted to the other main characters like telanah or one of the others
from what i understand  she was bisexual  but yeah. i feel like they could have saved it for the third game and flesh out some characters and have a natural build up.
aloy got that baby carrot for you gals
this is one thing that made me not excited to finish forbidden west... she was so pretty and awesome in zero dawn... imo.   they killed my waifu.
she seemed a little disappointed over varl finding love
i knew that mess was going to happen  wokemess!!!! but still  i love the gameplay
i thought this would happen after avad  varl  and eren got no play
i heard aloy hated men in the first game because most of them were either weak or evil  so this doesn t really surprise me.
yeah i definitely saw this coming hahaha
i didn t have much against the horizon games other than the game came off as a game by committee that tried to do too much gameplay wise and felt to me like a little bit of chore to get through at times. the most fun i had was hacking the larger robo dinos and using their weapons against them. that being said and with this poor choice to crowbar in gender nonsense horizon  zero interesthorizon  frozen mildhorizon  forbidden purchasehorizon  burned fanbase
this was an odd choice period. the game takes place maybe over the course of a week. maybe. with the high stakes nature of this dlc s story  that s just not enough time face this threat  build a relationship with a new character that she s got no history with  and then form romantic feelings for. i was hoping that they were going to take the mass effect route and provide multiple choices. who knows  maybe they still will  that seems to be the biggest request from peoples  responses to this love interest  my boy sun king avad is waiting in meridian to give aloy the good life .also  i think it s worth pointing out  that picture with the abs is actually incorrect. there were a lot of complaints with that outfit  which became available in the frozen wilds dlc . it s talanah s outfit from the hunter s lodge  which is cool  however all they did was used her body and swapped her head for aloy s. i ve been playing through horizon forbidden west again and can confirm that aloy does have abs. but how much they ve reduced the  ab-age  i m not sure. i did notice that her arms aren t as toned so there s that. the girl had some triceps that could cut glass in the first one!
i ll never unsee her as nick avacado
it s all about that sweet esg score
i really don t care if she s gay  it s just weird from a story standpoint she hooks up with a random girl she just met rather than the other characters gamers have met from previous games who we have flirted with due to the choice options in the first game
i played the first game all the way through and i thought it was an interesting enough story but aloy was so insufferable the entire freaking time...she was raised by a kratos-esque father figure but she sure as heck doesn t act like it.
its insane i m done with hzd hfw i beat the game not long after it came out i had a blast was playing bunch stuff atm now this forget it not gonna pick up dlc. i agree you re spot on these game dev s are ruining everything its bs.
nah  the love interest wasn t the problem  problem was the stupidly forced shoehorning of it. aloy literally switches from being just impressed by her to suddenly acting like she s fallen in love. should have just kept the romance stuff to horizon 3 or given the love story time to bloom more naturally instead of rushing it.
it s low quality fan fiction level writing
@rein  yeah it wasn t my thing. i kept making excuses in my head because the intro of a love interest just felt shoe-horned in. i actually really do like the writing on horizon 1   2  so it was a bit jarring to see something so out of place like this.
players  so now that reddick has joined the  died suddenly  club  what s gonna happen with sylens gg  uhhh...uhhhhh....  drinker voice  aloy s ghey  by the way.
i d love to play the horizon series at some point because of how much inspiration it draws from zoids and how much it reminds me of the zoids lore with the zoidians and the wild zoids. but all this political crap puts me off  i d play the original game i heard the first game is pretty good and alloy looks great  but then it went downhill from there ! what the heck...
jeez i almost bought this game  good thing i saw this video first
my favorite part about video games is the music and exploration of the game world. the story comes last. i highly enjoyed zero dawn and forbidden west  and while i despise the wokeness  i get immersed in the music and the world  so the wokeness doesn t matter to me.
it was fine in ac odyssey  my kassandra went after everything that moved.
i enjoyed the first game for what it was however i definitely did see some of the flaws and certain progressive propganda though i felt it wasn t extreme enough to hinder my enjoyment of it. it s sequel though seemed to have doubled down on a lot that with making many of the characters including aloy herself more visually uglier and now this  i have honestly very little interest now in pursing anymore time or money in the horizon series.
when are we going to get past this !  people can love and care about whoever they want to love or care about!
you can turn down the love interest. i did in my play through. everyone was making it out like the player didn t have a choice.
mark my words samus is going to get the woke nuke next....
i m so happy that i skipped fobidden west even though zero dawn was one of my favourite games of that time. i was burned once with the last of us  i learned to listen to leaks and other info. as soon as i heared they were changing her looks to make her less attractive it became an instant skip for me. this was bound to happen.
i mean. i really have no problem with less then 5 minutes of gameplay that is optional in an otherwise amazing dlc. it wasn t forced onto me as the player cause i just clicked to no option . now if they force it on in horizon 3 then that s different.
i loved the first game... i tried to get into forbidden west but i just couldn t do it. they took everything away that made aloy who she was and turned her into a bitvh that is condescending to everyone and on b-line to save humanity that she hates apparently... not to mention all the writing issues that make zero sense.if you are literally the only person that can save the human race then you make sure you take every bit of help to make it to your goal  and dont go off dying alone in some ancient ruin never to be seen again. not just turn everyone away because you are a strong independent woman that can do everything alone.
despite biowares  failings  at least they have gotten the romance options in their games right. take notes  guerrila games.
this dlc sounds like a fanfic
its a myopic world view we can all do better without   get your woke out of my game!  and stay out.
see  this confirms more how even ellie was actually straight at first
esg is one of the reasons they keep doing this.
it s more about the gameplay for me  then eye candy.
horizon 3 aloy gets a sex change operation and it s now called big al
same here. that s the one thing that everyone is overlooking which is big to not miss.
giiiirl. forbidden west is sooo good.
i totally agree with you. i m sad that pretty much all games has masculine women and feminine men in them.
looks like the human race in horizon are doomed to die off lol
i smelled this coming the moment i saw the first game and was confirmed as i saw content creators play through it. you can have a strong female role without needing to make the majority of the supportive male roles submissive pansies.
executive mandate - make alloy a carpet muncher to show we support everyone equally .even if it doesn t make sense and we lose players.
kat from gravity rush is the only straight female lead sony had. thank god sony has forgotten about their japanese ip that way they cannot be desecrated but it also hurts since they keep on making cinematic movie games and miss their japanese ips
i need a game where we dont have any romance and just full on adventure
it s telling that for these people it s  gay  every time. as much as they talk about representation the people that make a big stink about this always depict characters as homosexual. no bi  no ace  no hetero  none of that. just homo.it s not representation if it s completely one sided.the real question however is thus at 16 00 was that about chris or leon  it was leon  wasn t it
i ve played both games and enjoyed them very much and i just had a feeling with her character that they would make her lesbian. even though erend was right there  she still goes for some random new chick she just met in this dlc. the media is a complete woke joke in every aspect  movies  shows  games  etc.
bought the collectors edition for this game. after playing the game and getting the platinum trophy. i started to regret buying the game the story was bad  it s true alloy has a hero complex even in the 1st game but it was explored in the 1st game . gameplay is almost identical from the 1st game should have bought elden ring on release than this game.
hades was right after all
so there dead anyway
@xenato  i miss hades
99  of them talk like modern people not those over  a 1000 years in the future.
@xenato  it s like they set up hades as this villainous presence only to basically give you no reason to feel like you did the right thing in destroying it
well  at least its optional. still  if there is a potential female love interest  then there should also be a potential male love interest which we can choose.
why can t they let the player choose  like what used to happen in rpg s  see bioware s dragon age.
yeah... this doesn t suprise me. if you do a deep dive into the first games  dlc lore it is hinted that catastrophic global climate change and its fall-out  was the primary contributing factor for the need of faro concepts to create their robots. at the very lease this path seems to be optional  and not in the dna of the overarching narrative for aloy.
glad a beautiful female like you is calling this out. i am sick of woke garbage... you gained a like and a subscriber.
who ever said tomato nikocado avocado was ever attractive
aloy was ready to mudshark it up for varl until he found his black girl.  and errand and the sun prince straight got stood up.  and they definitely made her less good looking for no reason.
these companies are just salivating to improve those esg scores. thanks a lot blackrock.
what happened to giving us a choice on the direction of the love interest like other games  it s such a simple thing to add!
as if what they did to aloy in the second game wasn t bad enough... i mean her motion capture actress is gorgeous and she was pretty in the first game. they made her look like she has a permanent bee sting on her face... this is just the stereotypical icing on the cake.
why did they take away her abs  how does that make her more empowered  seems like it does the opposite.
psstt... try ys viii  lacrimosa of dana. it s glorious. bombastic music  wonderful characters  and lightning smooth combat all set to pure  raucous adventure and exploration.
metroid dread.
@miketheenforcer  noted
@miketheenforcer  i second this. my god  that game is amazing.
the legend of zelda has a bit of romance between zelda and link but it s almost noexistent  so i d recommend breath of the wild tears of the kingdom when it comes out   although skyward sword has a lot of romance actually lol.in dragon quest xi you can choose to marry or not  in case you don t marry the game has no romance at all  but there is a character named sylvando which is a huge gay stereotype character and may be a bit annoying at times  but he s actually really funny and entertaining  probably my favorite in the game even   so i still recommend
i always thought aloy was more like ace i mean during the course of the games she hasnt even once have had any romantic interests to any of the characters
@ivailo djimdjinov  she clearly shows interest in a lot of characters  the idea of her being  ace  was never going to be an option. she doesn t push into any sort of romantic relations not because she doesn t want to  but because she s got far more important things to worry about such as  idk  saving the world from sure destruction. she flat out admits several times that she does have interest in romantic relations  but just can t commit to one.
they did give you a choice at the end of the dlc. the heart for love  the brains this isn t a good time  the fist which is flat out rejection. i chose the fist option and i was done.
go look up fortnite aloy  they kept her original appearance before the devs of horizon butchered her appearance.
wat are you even talking about she looks fine in the actual game. have you even played the hfw for yourself  or are just brainwashed by all the click bait people like mel use to get you to watch there video s.
it always felt like she and erend were supposed to be a couple. or at least her and varl. but then they paired varl with another character. i haven t finished forbidden west  but i definitely think this is wrong to do this to her character
melonie don t most girls want to be the attractive female in fantasy too  i mean i see girls love collecting shapely anime characters. same as us guys dreaming of being strong like kratos or batman .
glad i never bothered to play this in the first place
lara croft the classic still for me
that s what i thought too! love the first game but this one.... not so much. gave aloy a fat face and turned her into a jerk. loved her in the first game and i was so disappointed. and you re on point with the fat face and skinny body. i thought the same thing. how
someone in the dev department must ve lost weight very quickly and with a gastric band and lipo-suction. so they retain the bone structure and fat in the face and they  re skinny in the areas where they had the fat removed. so someone lime that wanted to see themselves in-game. simple.
the scissoring mini-game will be in the next dlc.
luckily i ve never touched this game and now i m very glad i didn t. to be completely real with you  melonie. i don t even get furious when i see this anymore. i simply just double down in my convictions and simply stop supporting it...if i even was in the first place. go woke  go broke. and i m not even political. i just already have to play more and more female protagonists as a white man who grew up in the 90 s mostly playing male leads  which is fine  but now they re wanting me to play a female who is attracted to females leaving no male representation at all in my games other than usually the antagonist is a male and usually is white which also fits their narrative they re pushing. it s a shame since 90  of their consumers are just normal people who don t believe in this new ideology the media is trying to force upon everyone. additionally  and to simply summarize it up  they can do whatever they want with their money and i can choose to do the same. now  i wait for a reply to this comment telling me   l take  or some garbage.
i feel like people like me may have had a hand in this... lol  i m a straight male who likes to create female characters in games... and then  if there are  romance  options  i can t help but go with the females. so  i guess all of my characters are gay   _   _   maybe gorilla is just full of guys who like women  lol doubtful in the games industry  i know... xd
also  the voice actress came out queer pansexual  whatever that is  july 2022 after being in a relationship for men her whole life
i have 2 psn profiles and platinumed horizon zero dawn twice. we re talking 200  hours  the only  thing i won t do is play the hardest difficulty   thankfully i didn t need to for a platinum.   i have never gotten the sequel   i heard all the news about last of us 2 and feared sony especially with sequels and i guess i was right. so i m playing resident evil 4 remake instead. at least ashley is still a babe  lol. though they did change her outfit a little   and ada s a lot. i have to admit  ada looks more realistic for the job she s doing  but then... who plays re games for realism  lol. back to aloy  she looks like she might have the g - virus
did anyone not see this coming a mile away
erend always felt like a bro. plus he s a drunk  that s a turn off. she s always had more chemistry with avad.
@sup  see i felt pity vibes from her towards avad. she seemed bothered by how quickly he tried to get her to stay with him. whereas she usually drops everything to help erend
@starsan yeah  i got kicked puppy vibes from avad too  but i feel like they could grow together.
another modern franchise that has been fully thrown on to the compost heap.
sony did not go far enough. aloy s new squeeze should have both the  l  and  t  alphabet badges.
for a moment it sounded like what you wanted for a female lead is frey from forespoken lol
i liked in cradle of life that the ex boyfriend turned out to be ex for a reason.
and guerilla games wonder why gamers decided to buy games like elden ring and somewhat did not entertain the sequel so much.i had enjoyed the first game very well. it was one of my favorite ps4 games when it came out but then  when the sequel came out and i played it for a while at my friend s house  i really did not like the character arch at all. aloy seems to be in a hurry to be somewhere all the time  always seems to be angry at everyone around her and treat her male colleagues like they were gum under her boots. i thought it was because the story plot at first but seriously  it become so unbearable to watch a character behaving like that for hours in the game. fyi there were hints of homosexuality in the game even in the first game itself  especially with the npcs  but to turn a heroine into a gay is simply a slap to the face of all female gamers out there who makes up at least 45  of the gamer community. we did not like that crap in lou part 2. i do not think anyone going to like it in this game or the next one to come.
i guess that s why it s called  forbidden west
i haven t played the other. since you loved it  would you recommend playing it  and your hair looks incredible by the way.
you know im so good with motor skills that i got bored and i decided to see if i could play spider man on ps5 only using my feet. had to turn it on easy because my movement was limited but i actually kicked ass  i impress myself sometimes.
great!!  now i see ms garrison scissoring in that episode of south park thanks!!scissor me timbers!!!!
gameplay wise it s improved in some ways  now story  i skip everything lol. i ve never seen a game world where there s more poc females or females in general doing all the male roles or talking down to male characters lol.
@damascus  yeah going back and playing dawn noticed a lot of male characters aree either evil or dumb expect for ross.
when i first watched gameplay of the game. i felt bad for ted faro. yes  he made horrible mistakes  but i thought him helping with zero dawn was his redemption. then i believed he went insane because of his guilt and fear over what he did that drove him to delete apollo and kill the alphas.but then  in the sequel  nope! he s evil pure and simple! no redemption for him! i thought that made his character pretty cheap  given how big this story is. and the way they put elisabet sobek on a pedestal  almost to godhood the way it sounds  they re really overdoing it. the way she bullied ted by constantly reminding him about who s at fault for the robots going rogue  even referring to it as the faro plague. she didn t seem like the kind  compassionate person aloy seems to think of her as. i think if aloy ever met elisabet  she would be mightily disappointed.and yeah  aloy seems to be a lot like her mom. cold  over emotional  and self righteous.
for those who speaks about this woke thing  guerrilla games gave three options. you as a player decides. this becomes a moot point. if guerrilla games forces it then this discussion would have ground to take pace.
end of the franchise for me. i introduced the first game to my young daughter amongst other female centric games. she loved it.  i am not exposing her to that garbage. she wouldn t like it anyway just because alloy is so ugly now
i heard that the dlc gives you a choice  to kiss the girl or you can reject it i saw the ending
let s be honest... how many of us didn t see this coming  because i m not in the least surprised.
go full rpg and allow the player to choose their romantic npc partner. but would fit the agenda.
formula sounds very familiar! way things are going with the series  next games antagonist will be a female that has a crossfit and powerlifter physique. why do developers choose to not follow basic fitness logic  when creating character models that cannot be personalized  as someone that has trained with people of various ethnicities  genders  and orientations it had no bearing on their job performance. what did matter  was how proficient they were at their skill level  or pay grade. games are for escapism and to constructively release violent emotions. indoctrination  pushing an agenda  or reeducation has no place in entertainment meant for enjoyment!
i can see all the lgbtqia !lmnop people saying she always shunned men and i m just being homophobic but i ve always seen aloy as being too focused on the incredible burden she bares as the only one who can possibly save the world. she showed an affinity for male characters but often brushed it aside to say she doesn t have time for that.
i feel like nowadays everyone in the western mainstream media - any media  movies  tv  books  games - everyone is afraid to make the ugly woke mob feel threatened by the appearance of the fictional characters. no sexy good looking women  no strong authoritative men  especially not white and straight   unless they are caricaturized villains. makes me sick of this bs to be honest. thank the lord for independents  indies and the cultural differences with the orient.
western female mc s  pretty - uglyeastern female mc s  hourglass bodies with a pretty face  -  still pretty af
like it s a decent game with interesting enemies with cool designs  can it just be that  do we need relationships at all  straight or not  in our robot dinosaur game i agree they made aloy ugly too  why did they add blemishes and shit to her face in the second game  lol
melonie you are the best women thanks for your video we seport you 100 100 we love you  good job
is this a personal player choice or does this occur without player input  kind of like female shepard in mass effect is only lesbian if the player causes the interaction with said female to become sexual. lesson learned even after the apocalypse do not go to california even after its destroyed it can still turn you gay.
i guess me calling it horizon  zero dong was about right on the money!
the game does force this on the player.we get into the dlc aloy starts being more flirtatious to sayka it s out of character but ok she likes her just trying to be nice i guess. this flirtatious behavior took me out of the immersion of playing at times. because i was just there a 3rd wheel to this unrelenting romance between two women. it s the reason i stopped playing the dlc it was so forced.
maybe seika is a dylan mulvaney
hey melonie. you look amazing hope you re well
i am not surprised but this sucks.  i would have liked to see something between erend and aloy.  a slow developing relationship between the two of them would be a perfect thing to keep people interested in the series.   my favorite video game relationship was between nathan drake and elena fisher and took all four games to develope.  made it feel real and natural.  i think doing the same with aloy and erend would have been great.  maybe even take more time in developing that relationship.i had prepurchased the forbidden west because i loved zero dawn so much.  however  also was somewhat apprehensive over the game.  storywise  how do you follow up zero dawn.  it is not easy to do.  zero dawn  i couldn t pull myself away from the game.  any chance that i had  i was playing that game.  i even took my ps4 on a business trip to play the game when in my hotel.  i still have not finished forbidden west  and that is in no small part to the story not being as compelling.  while some there are some new game play mechanics that i really enjoy i don t care for the world as much as i did in zero dawn and find myself playing zero dawn more often still.
strange how the base game started with sun god shipping for no reason  almost like it was to get the audience off their backs
well she is a manly character now that i think about it  when you said she likes the farer sex it made sense. not that i agree  that s the problem with character development. its like a woman cant be strong female anymore they must be masculine characters.
i played a bit of the new one before the dlcs dropped.  i m not touching it again
just wait  til geralt transitions in his next game.
shows how desperate these writers are for attention  they don t care about how fans or potential fans feel about it........
i miss the old days.
making aloy ugly is probably sonys biggest crime.  even more than hotshots joel golf.  i have no interest in ever giving sony money again
so cringe  truly  the only saving grace it s that it is an optional side content in a dlc  i hope it means that they will add other options in the third official full fledged game  not that i actually wanted romance  usually they are not that good in games  but since they officially added it like this now i want options
i was looking for her to end up with varl. war chief sona s son.
you can blame the degeneracy of western society influencing the games tech industry. i m afraid i will start seeing that in the eastern games tech industry. i ve warned one of the companies whose games i love before to watch out for walking that path. i play games to disconnect from the world. i don t want politics and social agendas influencing my games.
i saw that shit coming since the first game
the last time sex belonged in a video game was leisure suit larry.
how can aloy be lesbian if she didn t have any experiences with her mother but instead all her childhood was spent with a ruggedy  lonewolf hunter called rost  she would be attracted to beefy  strong women if she was lesbian at all. sexuality is informed by your childhood  as cringe as it sounds. life is sometimes cringe.
tbh they already pushed that agenda with her  mother  elizabeth in the main game  who was also in the same sex relationship. which was the most predictable plot  twist  in a videogame ever...
they did say  forbidden  west didn t they
don t wanna make male gamers feel weird by giving creating a male romantic interest in the game. can t have that.to be fair they can do whatever they want with their game this doesn t sound bad to me just based on the article read in the video but i also haven t played this series so maybe it goes against her characterization before. i just think the trend is funny and how people cheer it on when really i just don t think a lot of male gamers would care about romantic options with male npcs even when playing as a woman so this makes it where you can still get to romance a female character. pretty sure if this npc had been a man most straight male gamers would just go  nope  and walk away at the confession scene
and they go woke i swear this people are woke but not waking up
i have no idea what s up with this game but looking at their face models i don t see exactly ugliness or beauty  i see ambiguity. ambiguity that obviously has to walk hand in hand with the topic of love interests in 2023...
they robbed my boy errand so hard! like how the crap man ! the build up between those two has been throughout each of the games. like come on man.
i ll be sticking with the main story  that s why it s a dlc.
enjoyed the first game when it came to steam and when this comes to steam it wont be added to my library
with esg scores if they don t do this they will not be eligible for bank loans.
history will look back on this period of time with disgust ...
new video drops right before i start my cardio! great timing!
zelda still hugging that master sword to her chest. just saying.
being heterosexual and not trans is the most stunning and brave you can be these days. government and corporations will bend over backwards to help you if you don t have both those labels
the new aloy looks like that o doyle kid from billy madison.
wow.... my student gave me the previous game last year. never got around to playing it.... now i feel even less like doing so.
they did the same to ashley in re4 remake. 10 37
melonie i miss 2000 sony when they made games like jak and daxter 1-3 the getaway 1 and 2 and jet li rise to honor and sly cooper and mark of kri socom and primal .melonie 2020 sony is so bankrupt
the way they made her and all the female characters act i knew right away even before the dlc that they were going to make her a lesbian.
what i found interesting in the second game was that 1  a large percentage of the females you interact with in the world are gay. in fact  more than half of the female main cast are.2  the only straight male in a relationship got killed off
and don t forget  hollywood hollywoke also have a problem with redheaded characters... the ginger-cide
no offense but  why is something like this a big problem in any game for anyone  it does not look the devs forced it in the game  but it seems like the whole lesbian romance thing is done is a tasteful way. i mean if that s just who the character characters are and it has nothing to do with the story itself  then it seems fine. look at ellie and dina in tlou. that s basically who they are and it s not forced in there for  woke  political stuff. or even in tomb raider when some were thinking that lara croft may now be a lesbian because of her close friendship relationship with sam. they may be close friends in that way who care about each other  but it s not forced in there for those specific reasons.if any developers  japanese or western  create original  strong attractive female characters that are lesbians or whatever  but there is no romantic infatuation with any character in the game or has nothing to do with the story  is that really a problem  just asking that s all.
i m  so tired of this. i m  pansexual female but even for me it s  too  too much. it s  only gays now. a girl just can not love a person of the opposite genderin addition forcing a love relationship so poorly developed is a pain to observe.
this is why i didn t pick up the sequel. the first was quite good  but i m not giving anything woke my money.
perfect!!! good job staying on your fitness routine!
@melonie mac go boom  thank you. and thank you for being such a positive influence in others. it makes a difference.
hear me out. we like to see men in action because we like to think they are fighting for their women. the only context in which it feels right for a female to kick ass is when it s thrust upon her and she has to step up. a perfect example of this is in the movie braven with jason momoa. in braven mamoa is a family man and men come after him and his family. he s married to a woman who is a delightful traditionally feminine woman  dainty and gentle but in this circumstance it has become necessary for her to fight so it s amazing to see this woman whip out a bow to protect her family
thanks for the heads up. i enjoyed the first one  but i ll skip the sequel. i guess we should have seen this coming since they changed her design. and i see they waited until they collected the money for the sequel and then dropped this in the dlc to give the fans the middle finger. glad i play on pc.and it s almost like an admission that la is demonic by having her turn homosexual as soon as she gets there.and burning shores as in burning passion or the fires of hell.
luckily they kept bayonetta straight
and that s exactly why i only played through the first horizon zero dawn game.
ngl the hero complexion argument made no sense because she did save the world from hades in zero dawn so obviously everyone will naturally look at her as the hero  but her goin lesbian out of nowhere is kinda crazy cus she had so many opportunities with other characters so that aspect really doesn t fit with me
this isn t exactly new. there were a few characters in horizon  zero dawn who were clearly attracted to aloy and there were possible hints aloy would feel the same  even though they never went into it. but they also showed aloy being interested in some men as well.horizon  zero dawn was always woke  though  so this isn t surprising. forbidden west just pushes it even further.forbidden west also confirms that aloy s predecessor  the  savior of humanity   and the one who aloy is a genetic clone of  was in a relationship with a woman  so its not shocking they pushed aloy in this direction either.
first game was one of the most enjoyable campaigns i ve ever played but i hate what they ve done in the 2nd one. they ve turned her into a bratty  arrogant teeanager and it s full of woke horseshit. played about 3 hours and sacked it off  nonsense  what a bloody shame!
same  jak and daxter an franchise legendary
this is truly a terrible post apocalyptic scenario  most of the survivors will not procreate
aka  forced gayness in second games years after the first
@zero todona  but you can at least figure it out that she was at least bisexual in the first game.
i gotta disagree with you on that  zero dawn was definitely not woke. it featured a flawed but strong female lead  but she was no mary sue  and no identity politics in sight either. it was a very focused adventure. i don t see what made that game woke.
i dare anyone to go through the xenoblade series to find a female character being a hero for the sake of being a hero. or male for that instance. evil for evil  you have a rouges gallery in the third game.
the lara croft one was obvious since the new lara croft sure looks like the character in last of us 2
i agree with you. but also the problem with this community we really never focus on content that is not woke. i m sure there is a game out there that is not woke that would love to be covered. we need to stop buying these consoles. we are funding china and the communist party. china now has better nukes then us. my computers not made in china and just play pc stuff that is not woke.its sad that very few people in this community even covered star trek  picard season 3. that was one of the best shows i ever watched. i did not even watch season 1 and 2 because i heard they sucked.the boycott worked with bud it will work with otherings also.
c mon that hollywood sign would be completelly gone in less than a century. such a trope.
saw it coming.
i thought it was just my imagination that aloy looked fatter. i can t recall any other video game ever doing that to a character  especially a female one.
lord  grant me the wisdom not to write the twisted reasons why the heathen creators make the decisions they do.  you do not want melanie or her viewers tortured with my sick imagination  proving that the depravity of hollyweird is only a breath away.
this is so annoying haha such evil even in our video games.
this is one of the few times i wouldn t say it went woke. it was pretty clear this was the intended direction for her character to go in in the first game. while it wasn t explicitly stated in that game  people have predicted she would be bisexual at least since the beginning.
what is so funny about this world s  fixation  on wokeness is in her world she knows nothing about it.   no one ever catches the vibes she had for varl   oh we can t have that he s black  god forbid  and after years of straight characters and male ones to booth why cant she be bi    games are for everyone people need to grow up. she is not ugly this is the other thing.
not errend or varl   they did everyone dirty here.  i still haven t played forbidden west and i m not sure if i will now
i m at the point where if the characters aren t attractive i assume the game is woke and ignore it.
brokeback horizon. btw  all these characters are planting unsolicited kisses in ways that would be now perceived as wrong and not consented if the sudden kisser was not a woman.
well  there s the whole problem  she went to la. must be something pretty strong in the water if it s still there post-apocalypse.
and here i ve been wanting to play the sequel to horizon zero dawn.now  i m kinda wondering if i should skip it the way i did last of us ii....
hold up  now she s suddenly into women  did the writer just forget the first game and abandon the lines in the campaign of the second    so they f up the way she looks now just mess up her arc
it s crazy that the only way they can represent a strong female is by making them gay. i was just talking about this a couple weeks ago. it s happening in videogames and movies. the times of a straight strong feminine lead are gone.
yup still glad i didn t go out of my way to get a ps5. was kind of thinking about doing it for this but now i no longer have a reason. thanks for saving me money sony
i ve played both games now and i can honestly say i enjoyed zero dawn more anyway.
god forbid in a crazy world women have boobs and abs. some don t look like men either. shocking.
or sun king avad
well of course  only a man could really do the job so she d have to be masculine right
first possible love interest ! they did my boy erend dirty....p.s. this just shows aloy as vain  considering she falls for a character that is literally just another aloy.....outcast of her people  warrior despite others  etc....
maan  the next thing we know they will turn all their male leads straight  i can t even...  p
not that i feel she needs a label  but i always got the feeling from both games that aloy was  if anything  asexual. anytime varl  erend  the sun-king  or any other npc hinted at a relationship  aloy acted like she just didn t have time for that. and that includes petra   an obvious lesbian  as well. at least the kiss is instigated by seka    and seems to be brushed off by aloy  which is in keeping with her character.
that s the new sony now... i just preferred aloy to be asexual  i usually don t mind characters with different sexual orientation  but nowadays it seems that every game and movie needs to have one... and they focus way more into it s sexual orientation than it s writting itself of that character. it would be also better to just give us the freedom to date characters we actually like at least... so all players can be happy  i really liked that skyrim s aspect.
i pretty much stopped playing as soon as i saw that they had her as a lead as i foresaw this coming. gotta insert agendas when and where they can very likely over bogus legal fighting points to threaten the people who want to just be left alone who don t get along with their insanity. this is going to be a long fight but necessary to make the world better again.
video made me sad. ellie  aloy now lara  i m goong to have to stick to japanese games
to be honest i didn t like story in first horizon and i finished it just recently. aloy was realy boring character for me  she had no personality what so ever and dialog options didn t help. i played throu entire game only becouse of combat system which was finaly something new in aaa games. i ll also argue that hero complex thing started in the first game  also dialogs in last parts were so bad i wanted to comit sudoku yes i know what a said . i won t play forbiden west becouse it s seems to be worse then orginal and orginal wasn t even that great. and for the last part little something for gamedevs who says that thier games are not for  input ur woke bs here . move over to indie or to book writeing  becouse most players are white males and females with males advantage depending on country and genre   so you can make games for us  or almost no one. and makeing games for no one is a problem when there are countries with lover gdp then your games budget.
they just assume all women are okay with bisexuality as default
in a few years  every main character in all media will be lgbtqia  despite the fact that that entire community is less than 5  of the population.
that was a great summarization of why i don t find characters like this appealing at all. no flaws  no edge  no unique quirks or characters traits. they re written to be too perfect in a way that feels hollow and synthetic.
i m disgusted this s the same videogame studio that once gave us killzone.
100  these characters are self-inserts of some woke troll behind the scenes.
well this is money saved. not buying this game or dlc by extension. thanks for the breakdown.
they gave her abs to abby.
i m waiting for the pc version  i m going to mod the hell out of it.
i ll tell ya what this is... this is the devs reading and or writing too lesbian gay fan fiction and then thinking  i ve got an idea...  oh yeah aloy somehow looks like she has mumps in horizon forbidden west
i am gonna totally be honest  if i m playing as a woman in a game you can bet yo ass she s gonna become a lesbian  unless there is an alistair or cullen involved ... but that s because i m a men and we think of 2 things all the time  beer and women.given that i never really manage to stomach aloy as a character... something in her behaviour and her christ complex never really jived with me. the character had a great premise but the game squandered it soo bad.
why d they make her look like dean norris dressed as a viking
this is why i play japanese games like tekken they aren t afraid to respect thier female characters and make them powerful and beautiful  instead of wanting to be men.
goes from red-headed model to red-headed chipmunk
i agree with the asexual part. but if she was ever going to settle down  the only two possible partners i could ever see her choosing were avad or erend.
here is an idea give her romance options  mass effect did it 16 years ago!
aloy x erend all the way  for me.yet either way  i would ve also accepted aloy not having a relationship  so far.
4hr ish dlc - aloy catches feelings   it just stinks of virtue signaling just for the sake of it
i ve seen that coming from far  glad i did and didn t buy the sequel
i played through this dlc  and while the new gameplay is fun  especially the metal gear solid scale boss fight near the end. every single interaction with aloy has her acting way out of character like a teenage schoolgirl or a twitter teenager. i m fine with her being lesbian if they really have to do that  at least will tolerate it in this case since they already made forbidden west full of the ideology anyway  but don t make your expansion pack fanfic level writing as an excuse to do a romance that makes them behave like a fanfic shipper s fanfiction.what bothered me most about forbidden west is  these far zenith guys  they re all corporate elite  with no redeemable qualities of nuance whatsoever. one is a private military company nutjob based off of the ceo of blackwater  another is like an evil jeff bezos  then you have carrie ann moss as the art dealer  informant who had a relationship with elizabeth sobeck and gets creepy at the end of the game.then in this dlc you got some kind of narcissist who s practically hollywood elite on steroids but worse. for a game series that had a lot of worldbuilding about a world that looked interesting  the only people of the 20th century we meet were evil  cartoonishly so.i just wanna save the world  kill robots  and learn more things about their interpretation of the 2030 s to 60 s  because their worldbuilding is pretty nice. not to mention this seyka girl is basically an asian aloy-like girl with a temper.romances work in a full on character rpg with multiple endings  which this one does not have since it s an action game with rpg mechanics and no choices  or if it s intended as a get-go and doesn t distract the narrative from the  full story.r.i.p lance reddick. sylens was a great character ad your performance sold him.
atp these companies gaming industry are doing too much
really sad. my dad really loves the horizon games. he s going to be so disappointed when he finds this out.
i think i played like 30mins of hzd and realized it was woke trash with their matriarchy  i knew it was headed for this so i quit playing and sold it.
you aren t missing much with the new game  after liking the first game i was disappointed with the sequel and i regret buying it. i passed on the dlc as well and i m done with the series moving forward. that goes for other future games that come out  if there s a female protagonist and she s unattractive   automatic skip
poor erend.
basically  this is a form of  social engineering.  the game-makers  seeking esg investors   higher esg ratings  environmental social governance   irrationally reason that if they show more  same-sex relationships  in their media  with characters that straight men  do not find attractive  they will somehow   normalize  same-sex relationships among younger  and younger audience members. and remember  the youth of today  become the future voters  and the future leaders of tomorrow. so  yeah  it s all about  social engineering  identity politics  through the use of popular media platforms. it has less and less to do with actual  entertainment  of any kind. it s all about their  distorted message  and how they deliver it.
and just like that  i decide to keep my money. these companies are stupid if they think we want to buy their multi-letter propaganda
i got a feeling that god of war is next. they gonna make atreus bisexual and i think gonna sprinkle some woke on spider man 2. yeah sony is going full woke in the future like disney. hope i m wrong
aloy x avad for me
either erend or sun king avad would have made sense. there s actual development with both  and both are generally just cool guys.
@lou sassole  erend is big bro energy
@sup  yeah i ve kinda thought about it and that s pretty accurate  tbh haha
no wonder the dlc got a low rating
they could have had a great series  but the fact that they deliberately chose to make everyone ugly to send a message against beauty was pathetic. now they re doing this to further alienate gamers sick of woke social-bullying to force their crap into everything  i guess they forgot that forbidden west was buried and forgotten by most within a couple of weeks of its release.
yay melonie!
bummer  dude. i honestly really enjoyed both horizon games. looks like i won t be picking up the dlc though. that saved money will be going towards re 4 remake instead
i knew this from the start   i m so glad i didn t buy it because i was sure she was bi or lesbian.
huh... cant say i m surprised
crystal will not do this to lara croft  they are not crazy enough  they are not out of their minds taking a character that has always been straight if you read the comics and the novels and turns her into a lesbian  they are not that crazy if they do this i swear...
nah  they already black washed his future wife.
i always wonder why these characters would be overweight whole always in combat. then it dawned on me the people putting out these afulterated versions of good characters don t believe exercise results in weightloss...
forbidden west was great for aloy character ! n i disagree they didnt make aloy uglier in fact its prettier more athelic which make sense just play the game cause those photos are miss leading plus they develop the character in the right way n i like it that there was no love interest well kind of but i dont like this thing in the dlc cmon if u gonna make her lesbian at least make it right theres a lot of character from zero dawn who also appears in forbidden west that could be the love interest but a random girl   cmon eron was the right choice for love interest !
aloy looks like the same as she did in the first game. that was just a different photo. i remember hearing about it before the game released.
right on the mark.
and just like that my ps5 is going out the window. i think i m done with modern gaming. i think i m going to take a page out of melonie s book   dig out my old ps1   find a crt tv   go from there.
i wonder which black actress will portray aloy in the disney  series.
that just continue to kill my vibes.  why must we be concerned about a fictional character s sexuality
she could of had the james earl jones conan remake with hekarro or a prince... she choose this
i m playing through forbidden west right now and i can t help but notice the amount of girl power in this game. almost every quest comes from women  many in position of power  all the men you encounter are weak  gay  or have some major character flaws  especially her simpy friends. aloy is slightly unlikeable in her interactions  especially towards men. i still really enjoy the game  but you can tell the game was influenced by contemporary politics.
if you will played the game you will know you don t need to kiss her. but much easier to read  shit on internet
keep up the good work
sony moving their hq to america was the worst thing they ever could have done
buying a custom new 3ds xl model. i d rather play best of nintendo s library for the past decade on that platform during my vacation than some of the games coming out. i agree they should have let it be in the players hands for choice as an arpg but they have to push the agenda.
hey melonie to be fair that is an option in the dlc also alloy  is the clon of elizabeth sovek who was lesbian so is already known for people who played the game but sure it would be nice some straight  female leader character.
there was no character development in dlc just some bad dialogue leading to awkward scenes  and it felt lacking in content. overall the dlc gives snapshots for how horizon 3 might be  just hoping they get better dialogue
to be fair  most of the men in this franchise were either little cry babies in need of saving or evil assholes. whereas the women were often the more badass warriors  so the writers really limiting aloy s options.
i don t know.   if i were aloy  i wouldn t trust saka.  she just broke up with nin-tendo.  kinda fishy!  lol
in forbidden west elisabeth sobek was made into a lesbian and since aloy is a clone of her the natural assumption would be she is as well but aloy paid no romantic attention to any of the other dozens of females she has encountered this is such a dumb creative decision
im ok with her into women! i feel the same way about lara croft
uh... but please don t actually throw your ps5 out the window  though. this wokeness fad is more temporary than it seems. there are other games waiting for you that don t have agendas!
i ll keep my ps5i don t want ashley thinking she s unworthy.i just won t touch the game
@lou sassole  i m not going to throw the ps5 out yet. i still need to get my  900 worth out of it. if anything i ll probably throw my tv out the window it s on its last leg anyway lol.
@mohawk_productions  right  i actually got the horizon bundle   stupidly i never bought anything for extra storage so i ended up deleting the game. now that this has happened i think i made the right decision.
@jc2  yea i lucked out and got the ragnarok bundle but yea ignore the woke crapas i said in the comments section of one of my shorts i work graveyard shifts and have around 5 hours every morning before i go to bed at noonmy times precious and i m not spending it playing woke crap where they turn aloy into a fat lesbian all because some women are pissed cause  omg my boyfriend acts like a guy!!!! idiots
i got 100  and the plat trophy on hzd and had no idea aloy s mom was supposed to be lesbian  where did they say that...
@melonie mac go boom they didn t in the original game. it s stated at the end  she was too busy for love. she wish she had a daughter though  who was curious about the world around her.
@melonie mac go boom  in the second game it is clarified  i also think i remember that in the first game there were some audios of elizabeth with another woman implying that they were more than friends  nothing very specific by the way
i don t care about aloy s sexuality. what bothers me is the developers forcing it down our throat.
horizon s protagonist looks worse and worse every time i see her. now she s looking like nikocado avocado after a sex change. if sony keeps this up  she ll make razor fist look like lili from tekken.
what we all really want is a game with a heavy set  ugly gay woman  - said by no one  ever  including heay set  ugly gay women.
to be fair mel  aloy has always been attracted to women.  they ve made that pretty obvious through the first two games
this is how devs tells their consumer to stop demanding for a sequal. they do it to the last of us  now this. i am done with horizon all together. not the same playing the first game.
they had to eff up horizon didn t they r.i.p. horizon series 2017-2023
well  damn. i liked the first one intended on buying the horizon game  not anymore.
can you keep these spoilers outta the thumb nail i m playing this right now lol
japanese development teams are the best. no agenda.
i thought that boy see saved in the beginning was a great match. thanks from panama city beach  fl
don t worry zelda still likes link.
these ideology pandering companies need to be introduced to the sacred ideology of boycotting.
if relationships happen in an dlc. it is non-canon or won t be seen in the next game. they gotta stop  shipping  something only less than 1 percent of the population believe in. i hope they know majority of the world is straight..
hollywood ther where creativity goes to di
i was a huge fan of the first game. the second game has failed me.
i prefer aloy without the love interest. if she had to have a love interest  then i d go with erand.regardless  i have another reason not to get a ps5 and instead save up for a pc.
yep.....i stopped playing forbidden west the first time after some side mission where you help a trans dude who said he felt more comfortable in the girls armor. i started it back up like 6 months later and skipped all the side quests and finished the mainstream story. i knew this was coming. next sony will make kratos gay
she ran away to hollywood to explore her sexuality...lol...
i played the first game.  it was pretty fun and the story was pretty cool but the over the top wokeness was painful.  all the women were strong brilliant leaders while the men were all drunks or crooks or cowards.
modern games be like  you get to kill robot dinosaurs.  oh cool  and what do you get to do in the dlc   be gay.  ...
i mean just look at resident evil 4. the original from 2005 was somehow more woke than the remake lmao and i know wokeness was never their intention  nor do they care about it
can anyone say last of us  same issue
@jonathan stevey  hard agree
the first game was already pretty woke as is  but obviously forbidden west pushed it to the next level.
even if assassin s creed valhalla is far from perfect  they at least gave the player options when they wanted to have romance or just a night in bed options in the game.you can choose to have a male or female character and you can choose to romance a man  a female or both  no matter what gender you choose to play.or you can choose to have no romance at all.i would have no problem with them creating aloy lesbian from the start  but from having her having some flirting with men over a long period in her teenage early adult life and then suddenly turning aloy into a lesbian during a short stupid conversation at the end of a dlc  is so extremely cringe and it feels extremely forced.
i work for bed bath and beyond. today i just got confirmation i m going to be out of a job  along with everybody else.  if any of you are the praying type  i d really appreciate it. thank you.
in the past  there have actually been cases where female protagonist was supposed to be straight  but they cut it because they thought male gamers would be offended if their avatar was hit on by another man.  so  if anything  a set female protagonist with a well developed male love interest would actually be refreshing. as a female gamer  it gets annoying at times.  lesbian romances are often more developed. simply because statically  there are still more male players  and lesbian romances are made to appeal to them as well.take cyberpunk  for example. the lesbian romance beat the straight female one by a mile.i know that s not the case her  but i suppose my point is that using a female love interest isn t necessarily always as  progressive as they think.
i felt the lesbian angle was unnecessary   shoe horned honestly  but  to be fair  the final  embrace  is an optional choice in the game.  it s just  there s no choice for a heterosexual relationship for aloy of course
next  spider man likes venom too much
aloy showed interest in one guy really....maybe two but mainly varl. she was flat out jealous when he got with zo. jealous. errand was friendzone material and i liked it because i felt he clung to her for silly reasons. now they did reveal elizbet was lesbian though they madd it clear that romance wasnt her focus at all  and the chick she met who ran the quarry was clearly flirting with her but aloy didnt display anything back  so i knew it was only a matter of time before aloy expressed feelings for a female character. that being said my only issue is she had a love interest at all.
i play the game for the gameplay. i hate that they have to push agendas.
aloy in fw is uglier than aloy in zd... . sorry but no.
loved the first. got forbidden west and a ps5. seen what they did and realized sony is literally destroying all their ips with woke nonsense. sold my ps5  for more than i paid  and i ve just been sticking with pc gaming. indie games are becoming more my thing. i still play the aaa most the time but i skip if any nonsense is attached. backlog is huge. these companies are going to start realizing people are getting tired of it.
lol  this game was already woke as all get out. aloy is perfect. they passed up on the chance to give us a truly diverse character. an awkward nerdy  female lead. one who struggles to engage in conversation but knows the ins and outs of survival and mechanics. one we could have watched learn about herself  and others while solving the greater mystery. instead they made her excellent at everything  despite being out in the wilds all her life she easily navigates society and never has to be taught anything. it s so obnoxious. the game also went out of its way to dumb down or demean the male characters and praise the females. it s the same sad song over and over. i want to be able to connect with my player character. but i can t  because she s perfect and there s never any flaws or quirks for me to find endearing because all women are now strong and independent and don t need no mans. i watched my sister play some of the first game and was looking forward to checking it out myself. after a while she said the fighting was fun but the rest of it was trash. she also said it was open world for the novelty and it did nothing for the story. told me not to waste my time. i m glad i didn t. what a waste indeed.
that game wasn t good enough to take risks like that.
this is why i avoid california at all costs. you never know what preferences you re going to leave with.
did neil druckmann direct this dlc
aloy was always woke.. the first game was tolerable  but the lore was pretty much in your face  men are stupid   down with patriarchy....   but at least it was playable when you could skip cutscenes and just play..  haven t revisited that franchise though.. oh well
maybe you should actually play the game before you criticize it.spoiler below for burning shores dlc the kiss is optional  you can choose it with the  heart icon  and they do kiss.the other two choices allow you to reject the girl with either an assertive  fist icon  using  i m focused on the fight ahead  i dont have time for romance  or intellectual reasoning  brain icon  this was also an option in the previous game where the sun king character tries to start a romance with aloy and you can reject him also using the same reasoning or embrace it.a girl being lesbian is not automatically woke.aloy was never woke.also...finding a girl  not attractive  doesnt mean they uglied her up on purpose  this isnt the last of us 2  its just how aloy has always looked.
i don t like this character or game i caught a production segment behind the scenes where the one of their dude tors on the project said that the actress who plays aloy wasn t going to be physically represented by the character  and i realize it s not the worst depiction of a female character  girl boss  protagonist in a game  it s not okay what they said their purposes were for making even those decisions. basically  he denigrates real women  and her actress as representative of actual women  as being too fragile  that  paraphrasing   she looks like she d cry if she broke a nail in the woods   so even though this game is praised and even female gamers are somehow enamored by her depiction  fir whatever reason  that this is woke friendly  and it is  it s also abundantly clear there s a tough vein of either fake support for that acclaim fr9m feminists or in a more twisted way they chose  as they continue to do  to make females  more manly  they literally are trans-ing female characters. it s lia thomas to the gaming world  they have a paraphilia  a fetish  they are better than women  and feminists have been so naive they didn t or couldn t catch that this was misogyny it celebration of female heroes. they are chris  of mr beast  they are alia thomas and his gang of fetishists. and  the gaming world should start recognizing it as we see more females become these man-faced monstrosities.
i bought forbidden west but i havent even played it and theres already bad news about the game
same with me  absolutely loved zero dawn and then they turned a caring  compassionate  rebellious girl into a full grown arrogant bitch! each and every single dialog of aloy in fw drips with disgust  arrogance and self-importance. every male character but for one is a laugheble frog. another could-have-been franchise dead.
it looks like she tried to eat a bee.
i can at least appreciate it being a choice instead of literally being forced upon you.still holding out for our boy erend
praying. just know that even if things don t pan out  god has a better plan. but i will be praying  nonetheless
@melonie mac go boom  thank you so much.
sony censors games  commands developers to alter certain characters of what they use to look like  and goes woke.    sony playstation community.
yep. didn t bother with it. saw this coming 10 miles away
if that s a choice there s literally nothing to cry about. dozens of games have it first  some of em almost 20 years ago. i m still playin and all this cryin is making it hard to avoid spoilers
@xenato  i understand it. not only does it feel somewhat forced  it s also some random npc who we meet here for the first time. i appreciate there being chemistry  which i see most with erend.i think i m probably gonna wait for the 3rd game to arrive and see what direction it goes. if i like what i see  i ll get to it and also play the hfw dlc. not gonna play anything at release anyway
man thank god i never played this game
zero dawn was great forbidden west is still definitely fun gameplay wise they didn t change the gameplay just improved it but aloy and the story is just worse and the dlc is just worse gameplay great storytelling subpar
remember she didn t play the game you can tell who played and who didn tbad takes all around
they were totally setting up erend to be the love interest in my opinion  what a waste
i mean  i always thought she liked girls from the beggining
love you  3
i m not surprised every character has to be gay nowadays  well think about this way least aloy s bad gene s won t be passed down to her children  she did the right thing by taking herself out of the gene pool lol
i m getting extreme last of us p2 vibes. can t wait for the golf club dlc lol.
beauty is outlawed
love the original and the first dlc  never played anything past that  specifically because i have no interest in playing as fatty mcfatface.
that s so silly they did that to aloy  she was pretty but then they spoilt her by being ugly shame that.
yup not surprised
i didn t want aloy to be with anyone  man or woman. makes her weak imo. why do the suits have to ruin everything  and i ll add this  jokes gonna be on them 20 years from now when they wanna make a game about aloy s kid.
it s annoying because it s just so typical these days... i still am enjoying the dlc though.
the word you re looking for is fanficy.
awesome! now i can uninstall with zero guilt. hooray. yes  enough reason for me.  no more money from me  either. fo they believe this will draw more straight players
wait i thought the game was about re population of the earth after event horizon.... wtf
that s why for now on  it will take several years before i start investing into certain games i want to see how things are gonna play out before i buy it. after horizon 3  i ll never get caught up again. i ain t got time for this gay lesbian bs
i am so glad i haven t bought forbidden west.
i know you said this in the video  but i don t get every strong  smart  independent  etc. female character has to be lesbian or has have a love interest at all. i m not saying there s anything wrong with it but why  it doesn t even fit aloy s character she s always been the type of person who s hyper focused on the task at hand and doesn t seem to be interested in a relationship with anyone.
we have to stop the word play gay means happy
this got me worried about future of tomb raider game..
i m gonna be a devil advocate here.going with all games lore is that alloy is a clone of dr elisabet sobeck and she was gay lesbian.agree that that new love interest a bit rushed. last think - at the end of the burning shores  spoiler  you can decided what to do next and game do not force you to proceed with romance   spoiler
i thought this game supposed to be rpg  wouldn t much better if player can choose their love interests instead of forced romance that totally unconvincing  her love interest isn t even in the whole 2 games  just a freaking dlc!
they successfully made an awesome strong female character and it still wasnt good enough
horizon zero dawn was a game that i surprisingly disliked  the core story irked me to no end for the simple reason that i could see everything coming a mile away  also because i couldn t come to terms with how dumb the devs made alloy. she had this thing on the side of her head for a very long time and she was still mistified with the  old gods  bs when everything is written for her in tutorials and schematics that explain everything as they are  yet she somehow retains  tribe  level intelligence. i can see why people liked the game for other aspects  obviously graphics and designs were great and the robots were awesome  but idk i see too many designs throughout gaming to just be wowed by just that.if anything the part of the story i liked way more was the faro plague  which i would have loved to experience first hand as a game or movie prior to playing horizon. imagine fighting an entire loosing battle in a game  all the while hoping for that magic bullet  only to find out the truth of project zero dawn. that would have been a great way of subverting expectations and then giving us the follow up which was the first game. alloy always struck me as the girl boss character that had pretty much nothing to her otherwise  so having her turn into a lesbo isn t surprising on top of the typical woke female empowerment.
you wanna know how you can tell that the horizon series is woke  look at all the antagonists in the game  not one is female. the only character who came close  that was not actually an antagonist  was the matriarch that tried to keep aloy from her destiny. arguably  i guess you could say that tilda was also an antagonist who was a woman. but her deception  being at the end of forbidden west  didn t make her an antagonist very long. despite that  look at what else happened  in-game  the males that died  served a purpose for aloy  to demonstrate how a man should sacrifice himself for the greater good. the women supporting characters  the female npcs  pushed the agenda forward that feminism and limiting masculinity are somehow the right course of action  while blaming  the patriarchy  for the apocalyptic catastrophe of the past  where it was a woman  aloy s direct ancestor  her thousand-year-old  mother   being who tried to save the human race with a woman-inspired ai  conveniently giving that ai the name of  gaia   the greek goddess. but you want to know who was conspicuously absent  in terms of greek names  zeus and ares -- both male gods who are seen  even now  as  problems.  yet they included both of zeus  brothers  poseidon and hades -- at which point they made hades  and haphesteus  antagonist ai. but my real rub is how the future  in a millenia  somehow retains feminist ideals and preferences  such as being gay or lesbian. in actual reality  that would not fly  because the human biological drive would be to have families  not relationships driven by lust  or other unstable biological impulses. ergo  while a lesbian relationship would have sufficed in horizon s lore  with tilda and elisabet  it would not have worked between the asian woman and aloy  simply because it would have been dictated by the realities of the world that human preservation was the order of the day.that being said  i do not see aloy as  ugly.  when i look at the character  especially in burning shores  she is matured  albeit faster than otherwise would be  and she is a seasoned veteran of combat  similar to a soldier. she is still beautiful. yet even i know that the kind of campaign she went on would fatigue and wear down even the heartiest fighters and combatants  especially in a world where there is constant fighting. this is  perhaps  the biggest lesson of the middle ages we could learn  yet we seem to have forgotten  particularly in light of how much human life would regress without modern technology  including medicine. we would regress  very quickly  to 1800s-era medical technology and understanding.it is because of this parallel that despite the story and lore differences  i find this game to be very much akin to the last of us  and how that game setting failed to make more realistic the degree of difficulty living in that kind of world actually is. it s also why a suspension of disbelief is harder to have.but what drives me nuts  what grinds my gears  is how  in making these stories  elements of them seemingly have to be sacrificed on the altar of modern leftist political ideology. and that does no-one  most of all the player and fanbase  any kind of service.
i could tell the new game was off when i played it. the original game didn t have any of that.
welp at least we know that the story of aloy ends with her. no progeny means this series ends when they are done telling the story of aloy. good riddance too  game was over-hyped af.
glad i never bought the games  knew this shit would happen
make them lesbian or a black character. they literally race swapped a norse god and made her the love interest in god of war which is based on greek and norse mythology lol. dude is a spartan voiced by a black guy too. this is what they do  they retcon your culture and then proclaim its  their interpretation   whatever that means  and will gaslight you into thinking  you re mad bro  as if they would ever have the balls to do it in reverse.
everything becomes grotesque on this games  what a shame.
im un-installing the 1st game  the one they gave for free for a bit  and i only played 15 min. of it. there are other games i can find  just as good...and dont compromise the charcter s sexuality.
good for nikocado avocado that he got to be in a game. the wig is a bit weird though.
no no no. it s been awhile since i played forbidden west so i could be iffy on the details but horizon forbidden west is anything but woke. a main part of the plot of the whole story  kotollos people the sky something or other is about a big chunk of the west midwest southern of usa freedom fighters. his people dedicate their entire existence to honoring these soldiers from the past who stood up to tyranny of big government. there s data points all over and in one very specific one it literally describes the soldiers as  conservatives . i don t remember exactly the terminology but the term conseratives as a descriptor was 100  used. i remember because i specifically thought about how refreshing it is that they are portraying conservatives in a good light. and like i said this groups literal existence is honoring these conservatives.i m so tired of people who trash this game but actually have no idea how unwoke it is. it s not ruined by a stupid kinda dumb sidequest and definitely isn t ruined by aloy being a lesbian seeing how that makes perfect sense because elizabet sobeck was too so who caresi love your content always check it out but someone has got to get it right on this game. because at least some of the devs behind it maybe not all but some  are definitely unwoke and i haven t seen one video about any of this stuff in the game. only vids trashing it because of a stupid side quest and those devs trashing elden ring.this game deserves people to actually know what s in it.
they ll just say she s bi but will only ever be with women lol like superboy and robin.
you mean gayloy
jesus.  my favorite game  the first one   now wokified.   i knew there was something fishy going to happen with the story.   glad i have preserved the original story in my heart  not spoiled by the second one having not played it.
honestly people have to calm down with that shit. it s the era we live in  it s the acceptance era so ofc they re gonna put it in every media it is the theme of the decade we re in. like when feminism was at it s peak you started to see strong female leads everywhere and you heard everyone whine about it and then it suddenly passed. this is gonna be the same thing here in a couple of years  i don t understand all the drama around it  just roll with it until it ends and becomes less in the face as it is now. the only thing that sucks is their implementation of it  it feels forced and rushed on a character we couldn t bound with beforehand.  but her being gay isn t a problem. the fact that the industry also have a hard time building compelling stories and characters doesn t help the woke implementation. it feels force because they don t know how to do it properly  they just drop it in so they can say  yeah that box is checked   that is the problem.and if you followed hzd it s clear from the first game that she s gay  if you re surprised because of the dlc you haven t been paying attention.
guerrilla games  never mind erend  never mind avad. here s an asian lesbian for aloy.
very accurate title  melonie.and the whole plot is an attempt to go back through metoo  weinstein and old hollywood is bad to cringe dialogue and plot point that doesn t make sense.i think they want to do it with lara in the next game  just watch. unfortunately. i hope i m wrong  but damn it  let them just try. i would wish the failure of sales to such games always.
wokified  are they turning into asian cuisine
the leaks suggest lara croft will have a female love interest  and east indian woman. so the same song and dance essentially lol
@melonie mac go boom  oh boy  here we go again. stay strong  melonie  your tomb raider enthusiasm is contagious and as a person who has gone through all the parts from the classics to the present day  i m not at ease with what they will do next  i m afraid that the  survival trilogy  will not be the worst in comparison with the future that awaits us  and this is not to mention tv series movies   i would like to say that this is just a rumor  but apparently it sounds like a fact  diversity   lgbt checkbox at the same time what they want   and i m still in favor of lara being an adrenaline junkie who has a relationship with her adventures
this isn t surprising  i was just thinking about how these game devlopers right now just want us all to be girls bring back og lara croft and we ll talk.
you should play forbidden west. the hero complex thing you re talking about is what aloy has to learn on her journey and realize she can t do everything alone. in due time she grows out of it and learns to depend on others is literally what core story is lol and great gameplay and awesome weapons. and you get to fly!
she doesn t need a man.  shes strong and independent  making her own way sticking it to the patriarchy.
those games had a plot  i only ever heard about how it s a different take on the monster hunter formula. is it still that too at least
ofc this had to go woke too
about your thumbnail  and i just finished the dlc.  you  are  given a choice.  i chose otherwise.
aloy is gay  of course she is
she was cloned after a woman was was a lesbian i think
all this butch crap is so demeaning to women. it s refreshing to see somebody like yourself stand for the greater good! nice job mac!
its not even surprising  one look at the game would tell its focus on  diversity   non white  non straight  but aloy was the weird anomaly in their mindset - they refused any relationship to her cause giving a female a relationship in these days is  regressive  but have hilariously 180 on that in a dlc with a random character
oh come on!... nothing is safe anymore
what s funny is the series has so much pointless dialog options most of the time but not on this. remember the good old days of mass effect and dragon age where if you wanted to romance a gay space pirate hermaphrodite alien you could  or go with the taboo option of being a heterosexual  thankfully my interest in gaming  movies  anything sony produces  etc. had waned so heavily nowadays due to lack of new and interesting ideas and everything has to be a political message in some regard. i m going to pick up hunting and carpentry
that s it  i m going to make a game starring a trad wife with machine guns!
i was hoping you d talk about how they ve ruined horizon. and i was having some comment issues last week  so i hope this comment sticksanyways  while i was reading i came across a quote that reminded me of you  melonie. thought i d share it...naomi zacharias wrote   ... if i had to choose between who i was before and who i am now  without being able to alter the path of events  i would pick the now  even with all that it carries. life was simpler before  i didn t carry some of the same sensitivities  and there weren t the same relational land mines another could unknowingly step into. but now i see the world with perspective  i view people through vastly different lenses and recognize beauty in things that once escaped my notice. god seems more mysterious- sometimes mysteriously confusing  absent  and maddening. but always mysteriously true. if i am honest  life is ever more complicated but undeniably richer if you take that quote and go back and watch your older videos  and then compare and contrast with your newer videos... i think it s evident that god has worked an amazing transformation in your life  melonie. it really is amazing to see how much you ve grown.it s funny how some people want to bag on you  saying   didn t you used to just talk about games  stop this anti-sjw crap and go back to talking about games!  it s as if they expect you to never grow up and forever stay in one lane to meet their approval. but thank god you chose to serve him rather than placate and lie to people. people might think you re being foolish for your faith in god  but remember  we don t serve the world... we serve god.having you shine a light to expose the reprobate logic of deconstructivist modern culture and calling out the hubris and sins of the entertainment industry is so edifying to watch.and even though you deal with more complexities as a result of what you do  there s no question... you ve changed into an undeniably richer version of yourself.and you stand as one of my very favorite people to support. thanks for always striving to be an uncompromising and inspiring light  melonie. god bless you
man can t wait when the fourth woke tomb raider game is going to be another 10 million seller for crystal dynamics. now that will make you go boom for real you dehydrated pick me.
i gave up on this franchise after the first game  i just don t care enough about it to be bothered. she is a fairly new character so if they want to make her gay go for it. they can have her for all i care!
i know it they will ruin her... just can t stand this anymore...
i loved zero dawn but couldn t play this because i m honestly burnt out on sony s formula of over the shoulder 3rd person walking simulators with like 3 movies worth of cutscenes taking up 60  of the games. not to mention all the hand holding  couldn t play ragnarock for the same reason
same way that tlou didstarting with a dlci know what will happen nextthey will find each other in the next game and make a male clone of aloy to make the baby a little trans with those fancy machine and that s it she will have a baby without  sex
meh. personally   i d give this one to the gays since they just seem hellbent on having a videogame main character of their own  and i like aloy enough since this isnt a main aspect of her character  though i would like some choice in-game . cuz i d play like aloy has a thing for avad  because hey  if i m giving up my coochie to a man  it s going to be the one who can offer half a sudom in case i divorce. also avad ain t a creep
at the end of the game  when it s useless functionally speaking. not something i can say makes me want to keep playing after the whole thing is over.
i am willing to bet that most people can comprehend the basic story theme at play here. unfortunately it is saturated with very obvious digs at male culture and forced toxicity that is completely alienating and off-putting to anyone that isn t an activist or obsessed with that topic. this game just gives off current gen attitude and the marketing that is painfully blunt. i picked up this title and as awesome as the combat and exploration is... i cannot connect with aloy anymore and the story no longer holds my attention like it did in the original. it ain t because we are missing something... it is because we can see it very clearly.
thank you so much  this really means a lot. i appreciate the support and encouragement
@melonie mac go boom it s what i m here to do  to be a supportive friend     hopefully when i comment you can instantly think   ok cool  it s otterloop. he s always in my corner.
i think it s funny how you never get many haters comments  just because you re not giving  100. you also always write fire stuff  but the haters seem to love venting their relationship issues in youtube comments lol. this is why i don t use social media except for yt and discord. love seeing the support  keep it up.
@lvthor ascending thanks  bats!  d i honestly can t afford to swing  100 anyway  i try to donate what i can  when i can. but ultimately  i just want melonie to trust me enough to know that when she sees a comment from me  irregardless if there s a super thanks attached or not  she knows i m here to genuinely support her. not trying to buy her off  not trying to do anything weird or shady... but to just be someone she knows is gonna be there to encourage her and be a friend to her. that s all i m trying to do
@otterloopb  best thing to do    i donate to a lot of my favorite content creators now  so the haters can miss me with the goofy comments. i used to hate the idea of giving but i m 30 now and i m being a much better person than i have been  hence the  ascending  in my name lol. i ve been getting merch as a way to support people too  it seriously feels better to support with a little something if i m able. if god says give when it s in your heart then i will. being a selfish antisocial hermit hasn t gotten me far  so i m going a different path and i hope a lot of these haters around here can man up and make the same change.
@lvthor ascending that s awesome! i learned quickly after high school ended that being antisocial is a dead end street. giving and showing grace toward people is so vital. you can t take money or possessions with you to heaven... but you can bring and build upon the relationships and connections you ve established.praying god keeps building you into an even better person
@otterloopb  thanks a bunch for that  i love my church and enjoy going and hearing the messages. being bitter is a lot more stressful than trying to be nice in a bad situation  though some days i still get pretty close lol. hope all is well for you too brother.
i m completely convinced that these game studios are just browsing through rule34 content and crappy fanfic to decide the direction for these female characters.
i always had my suspicions  tbh.
do we even need romance stories in video games   i d rather most of the game be the playable part  ya know   the action and challenge of the game  can we focus on that
being biological female doesn t cut it anymore. now it is literally every single game.
smh. as soon as i saw the headline of an article about the burning shores  anoy has a new  companion  . i knew where that was going love the games  and i will be getting the dlc. great story  amazing gameplay. love the fast pace action. but thank god i can skip through the cutscenes and the bs woke dialog. anoy is very unlikable character. strong independent woman condescending and belittling every male character in the game. wich gerilla made into a whiny lil weak simp. good for nothing. thank you gerulla for giving me a game that i can skip through the garbage. i git the jist of the story  i ll piece it together. just want to enjoy fun combat. i ll wait till it s on the ps store for the low low
so i guess i shouldn t even start the series than if they are just gonna fuck it up now
she was very obviously bisexual even in the original game. also the original game had plenty of agenda and wokeness in it. the women were all heroic and capable. the men were all incompetent or evil. the bandits were all male. i could go on. i enjoyed the game. but it was always woke.
damn  the nikocado game got a sequel
4 44  so your  female power fantasy  doesn t go all the way to save the world  huh  maybe is it better to stay in a relationship 8 16  hehehe.9 00  the game put an extra weight on its own shoulders  by betting on love  instead of pure attraction or  even better  something indistinguishable. i guess they were afraid of the relationship being rejected by players  so  come on  folks  they love each other! . this is stupid by definition  not the relationship itself.9 28  i m curious about a lara s love interest. but it has to be well prepared.
guys find aloy desirable...ew can t have that boosting sales  let s make it so their fantasies aren t canon.  what s that  they can still fantasize about her because she s fictional and now she comes with a female friend  but for real  just leave the romantic interest out of the robot dinosaur hunter story. it s a selfish motivation when there are much bigger stakes at hand.
my first thought is  this is probably a self-insert.
it s tough... i almost gave up on finishing the dlc when i started to see alloy s lines going towards a lesbian path towards a woman there s zero chemistry... also sure alloy is a clone of a lesbian. because apparently without a need for romance in the game they decided that elisabeth was a lesbian and so choose that being clone of a lesbian makes u genetically gay. and in the end despite have the brain and braw options where they don t kiss  the way all their scenes and lines are when they are together makes the kissing option the only one that makes sense! it s very annoying to make things this way because it feels like you re forced towards this option and by extension makes many things in the og game and this one pointless. after all why bother to make her be the desire of erend  varl and specially king avad and give dialogue options that clearly insinuates flirting  to then just making all that pointless because all of a sudden she s a hundred percent gay when i realized that is where things were going i got so mad i wanted to just rush through the dlc and be done with the game. but to make matters worse i had to beat the dlc twice because the dlc is broken so the aerial capture side quest wasn t working for me.
this is every western game now a day s
well i did enjoy the first game but now after knowing this i was pass on part 2
an optional choice right at the end of the dlc how is that anything but pandering
yea but why does aloy gotta look like nikocado avocado though
as a guy i don t have anything against lesbians  but i won t hate a game for having homosexuality. i don t hate games whether there are straight or gay characters as long as the gameplay and story is good i really don t care. since this is option similar to skyrim or assassins creed i find it strange people only hate this  also if people think having gay people in media is pushing agenda does that mean having straight people in stories is pushing an agenda   i don t discriminate against people because they are not pretty  my colour  shape or share the same ideology.
not surprised! since the first horizon  i was like   mmm  a female character... she never showed signs of being even a little.. little... little bit interested   even remotely   by a guy... she looks and plays like the independent    savage  woman   who  needs no man .... they made her super not feminine  unlike   eg  lara croft .... and knowing how the netherlands  guerrilla games are from there   are super woke   i was like.. ok... wait and see. and now... there we have it.  alloy had to be the ugly  masculine and brute lesbian ! of course   she had to...!of course   they had to find a way to put some kind of debauchery   some kind of sex  into the game  !@the guerrilla games hq  the classic monday meeting   mmm..so  dear colleagues   should we make alloy fall in love with one of the numerous boys men from the numerous existing tribes   especially when the human population almost totally vanished   and it became an absolute priority   almost a like a moral and civil right   to start a family   and have a ton of kids.... ...or should we go full woke   copy other titles like the last of us 2  and turn alloy into a true legit carpet-muncher   if we choose the option 2  it will be a great opportunity to finally show a woman with an amazing red pubic hair ! so far   people could only see black and blond carpets  and that   it s really racist ! alloy will make a fantastic red- carpet lesbo and there we have it. they had to destroy another beloved franchise. books   cartoons   tv series   super hero movies   regular movies   documentaries  everything   must respect some quotas  -1 gay character -1 lesbian-1 trans -1 nobinary-1 genre  356-1 genre  146why should everything feature gays   lesbs   etc
mass effect let s you chose who you want to be.horizon let s you be a lesbian. that s so progressive and inclusive of them.btw did lara went lez as well  i haven t seen that. that s news to me.
i agree with everyone who is saying that romance and love interests  of whatever type  weren t really necessary in a game like horizon. not every game needs a love story  in fact here it just seems forced and unnatural. something on which i disagree with you is that being a hero for the sake of  being a hero  is not really a  masculine  trait. it s a narcissistic behaviour that both males and females have. maybe  and it may be what you meant  men are more likely to manifest this behaviour in a more  saviour rambo  kinda thing. instead women maybe strive more towards the  advisor  type. you know those ones who are always ready to  help  you deal with everything  give you advice on anything even when nobody asked . but what they really want is just attention and to be praised. instead  wanting to do the right thing just for the desire to help others a very different thing and everybody can have it.
i was going to buy the base game  but now i don t feel like it anymore. got plenty of other games i can play first.
i ve heard enough! let them be
i bought the original  but i kinda regretted it because it was blatantly obvious that the game was woke. i stated this on many comments sections and was always ridiculed for doing so.  horizon isn t woke  they would always say. then the sequel comes out and its even more woke. and still people deny that its woke. then this dlc releases and its yet even more woke. so many people in denial about blatant wokeness. i never bought the sequel   i never will.
lesbian who loves an asian girl  alphabet people  check  anti racist  check. next dlc  she ll want to be a man and will use technology to achieve her dream  trans activism  check. so many boxes but it manages well i think. kudos to the devs  they ll probably get an award in the game industry next to naughty dog. so diverse  so awesome.
scissor me timbers!
getting rid of my ps4 was the best decision i ever made and this just confirms it.
0 16 oh come on  we all know exactly why they are doing this. its clear to see.
thank you for giving me a reason not to buy this game...
hzd was awesome  and hfw was cringe  but i wasn t done with the franchise until now. so sick of this nonsense
well i m glad i actually did not spent money on this game.
wait is elon gay in the game  that s awesome! every goddam game i ve played lately has been a complete het fest. just finished triangle strategy and every single one of the main 25 characters was hetero. it was f cked up and a real turn off for me
burning shorts  dlc
is the woke  romance  optional  i m still willing to buy the game  as soon it comes with the dlc  if i have a choice to decline reject the woman.
you mean  the same character that spent the whole first game belittling decisions tribe leaders and war generals make  while also not hesitating to let the player know how awesome she is at everything  shocker.
if it wasn t so common these days i wouldn t care but it s like every theme character is gay now.
good to know alloy will destroy her generic lineage. funny thing is that mihoyo  aka hoyoverse   a chinese company can make a wholesome and subtle lesbo relationship than anything the west can do.
and metacritic about to do the same thing that they did for tlou2 in shilling for the virute signal cause people critiqued it  no surprise the echo chamber of these companies defending each other
forbidden west was woke with the portrayal of men  this just confirms everyone s thoughts on moving the headquarters to california was a bad idea.
tbh aloy never wanted to be a hero  it s the circumstances that make her the only person that can save the world of horizon that aside this dlc felt like forced cringe woke propaganda that took a dump all over the magnificently crafted world and lore. this could all have been avoided by having a couple of dialogue choices that would lead aloy down a platonic path if we choose to do so.
the next step is to make aloy black right  cuz you know  she s a redhead
yes. it is optional.
just dont buy or play the game. there is no other way to express your disapproval. buying the game is absolutely approving of it.the female from hellblade is attractive. sure to be woke though eventually if not already.i am fairly sure that when tomb raider came out  they put a  hot female  character in a game that men would want to watch. just look at online games where you can choose your gender and appearance  and a significant portion of male players create hot  busty  breast size slider to far right  wasit slider to far left  female characters. that is the recipe for all of the success of the tomb raider franchise. then  decades later  there is a decision to target a completely different audience and completely ignore the initial appeal and reason for success  and pretend that all along laura was there to draw women into gaming. now just add in the woke agenda push  and shes suddenly and ugly lesbian. yay  just what every young testosterone raging boy wants in a game  right  or are straight teenage boys still not the majority demographic by a landslide
i wanted the dlc but i wait all this time to get indoctrinated i just want to play a game and not be forced an agenda
we will continue to see all gaming gals made more masculine to the point they are indistinguishable from men. this isn t a lesbian kiss. it s a straight man coded to look like a woman
well between the cross dressing character earlier in the game and now this i m done with the horizon series!
hate to say  but i saw this coming. forbidden west had some sketchy politics and a pride rainbow facepaint.. which i  of course  didn t use. gameplay was good though
aloy is way out of seyka s league
joanna dark from perfect dark and samus aran. comes to mind and of course lara croft.
alreayd hated the dlc being only ps5 and hated alloy s  do-it-alone  complex and now she has to be lesbian when she had 4 guy s that liked her and lost 2 in her stupid mentallity of doing things alone. the more i hear about this dlc the more i hate it and alloy too now.edit   they can t make mistakes  me  um.... alloy makes mistakes  not letting peoples help her  trusting the man that betrayed her in the first place.
why cant we have a strong female character who eventually has a family  why cant her main motivation be to protect her family  that would be very accurate in certain environments.
does every hero need a love interest  like i was just enjoying the gameplay and story  don t ruin it and give her a love interest like come on y all.
this feels a lot like the last of us s dlc left behind when they shoehorned ellie being a lesbian into the story  completely ignoring the clear flirting happening between her and sam in the game- even going as far as to make sam way younger in the show so people don t get that vibe again. now aloy is gay and what- we are supposed to just forget all of the flirting and stuff she did with male characters in the past two games
even melonie mac wear rainbow t shirt
no  they didn t go woke  and there s also no  again . there s a stronger argument to call the horizon games  based  than there is  woke   given the main villains are basically wef globalist types. this is optional content  no different than the myriad of romance-able options across hundreds of rpgs.the only legitimate complaint for burning shores is that its too short. i preordered it as soon as the page when live  downloaded during the preload on the 18th  started it on the 19th  and beat it on the 24th. lot of the content isn t tracked in the quest log  a rare mistake for gg in this series  but its way shorter than frozen wilds. there s only a couple of marked side quests  which  to their credit  are very good . . . but i still finished this expansion in about 4 days. and 2 of those days were in the work week  where i could only put in an hour or so before bed. realistically  i think you could beat burning shores inside of a standard 2 day weekend  assuming you did the content of the base game and upgraded your gear appropriately.
she looks like a chubby guy in the new game.i never got the second game because i felt like they were going to go this way. they just can t stop themselves. my trust in developers was destroyed with me3 and reinforced my negative sentiment with last of us 2. i heavily screen my games these days if they are from western developers because i just can t trust them. japanese games though i really don t need to screen at all  thankfully.
it is a thing because those characters are self-inserts.
ohhhh  that explains why they killed the black guy lol.when it happened i was   wow  the wokies had the balls to kill a black character. you don t see that anymore! now it all makes sense  they were planning this all along.i should have guessed it would end this way they confrmed elizabeth sobeck was lesbian.
can t stand that wokeness has invaded literally every entertainment we have.
well  another franchise i m done with.
guerrilla games is a video game developer and a subsidiary of sony interactive entertainment headquartered in amsterdam  netherlands. they are overall one of the largest and most prominent european developers. not a western company.
i thinks it sort of weird that she s doesn t like females characters that  save the world . zelda  samus aran  lucina  fire emblem  pyra and mythra  xenoblade chronicles   bayonetta  and so on and so on  etc  and doesn t given them a chance.
varl was killed in forbidden west
most dlcs are kind of short
the netherlands  and europe in general  is considered the west
@melonie mac go boom  i never consider than.
the alphabet gang are the most over represented group ever. in fact  it s so rare to find a heterosexual relationship in modern games.
horizon forbidden west burning clams.
i finished it last night.there are 3 options for that  choice . of course  i knew  the gay  was going to be one of them but chose the fist option.the woke isn t as bad or in your face as you d think. in the 2nd one there is some guy who  chose to wear a woman s armor  and is part of a side quest. too bad you can t kill npcs.aloy is not a lesbian. anyone with half a brain can understand the overall plot and numerous arcs and a  relationship  is nowhere near an integral part of it. aloy isn t someone who s going to be tied down any time soon.of course  the woke have become so dangerous that  damned if you do  damned if you don t.  but the lesser of two evil is  supporting the woke trash .the moment a creator or whoever forces a character into a choice like that  then it alienates people immediately.sadly  there has been porn of aloy since the first game came out and those same people are the ones pushing for her to be a lesbian.
this is why i prefer playing jrpg s made by smaller developers. no politics  just fun games. western rpg s just like all forms of western entertainment need to keep pushing  the message . i am surprised the love interest wasn t also  trans .
they shit all over every male character in the first game  saw this coming years ago
i was cool with zero dawn and its story. overall  i like aloy as a character  but when it s something shoe horned in that  it seems like pandering to me. this is a pass.
diablo 4 just announced  making the game for a broader audience  !!!! r.i.p
on your gaming channel  would you consider playing starship troopers terran command  it looks really cool imo  sort of like command   conquer generals but with space bugs.
lessons i ve learned from games.mass effect  no matter what you do  nothing matters  your decisions are meaningless  there are only three colors.tomb raider  there are a million ways to die  it doesn t matter how hard you try you ll never be a tomb raider   you ll always be rising or living in her shadow.elden ring  maidenless virgins go mad and destroy the world.horizon zero dawn - burning shores  never go to l.a. because the only way to get anything done in california is by being gay.
i ll stay with pc and nintendo
having played forbidden west i am not surprised at all. there was a side quest where you help out a transgender person and they made elizabet sobeck have a relationship with the villain of the game so it was obvious where this was going. i won t be buying the dlc because of this. i m sick of this junk being being pushed on us.
to think i almost buy this game
i mean at least mass effect gave you several choices of who you could romance! it s a shame i like horizon games but i ll just avoid the dlc and any other installment
honest question. how many gamers who say they re sick of this crap  will still get this dlc  ya gotta vote with your wallets y all.
forbidden west so was soooo woke  didn t even consider the dlc
i won t object to how ever a person wants to live their life but video games should not have this stuff on it because its like adding it to the game as a publicity so people that agree with that stuff will buy the game. hey btw melonie just a heads up you will enjoy horizon forbidden west alot more than zero dawn besides this other stuff they added to the game this game has a stash feature so you dont ever again have to destroy stuff just to loot more stuff now it all goes into your stash chest allowing you to go get it later on...so you dont loose anything you loot
i was gonna buy this game because it looks great  even got it on my wishlist and all... but... with this news  i would actually rather shit in my hands and clap than buy this game  d but i guess im a bigot
also  when i played forbidden west  i noticed aloy was somehow less personable. less pleasant. that s another annoying trend in media  making female characters assholes for some reason.
i m not really sure this is woke. a male writer is going to be happier writing a lesbian character rather than a straight one if the character is going to have a love interest. isn t it just much easier thing for a male writer to imagine than if the character is interested in guys.
this video made me gay.i thought it may un-gay a friend of mine and i showed it him. he liked the game but he s still gay.but the problem is  now i m gay

@kevin ramirez  oh wow a laugh react  very impressive. i m sure you must be very proud of expressing yourself as a mocker.
they also did the same thing with ellie in the last of us dlc.
i was playing through the first game that was gifted to me via steam when i found out about the leftist undertones.  i stopped playing.  i will not play the second game  or any other.  there is no room for wokeism in my gaming library.
i thought it was optional!!
it s cool  every time they do this crap i save money by not supporting whatever content they choose to push their gay agenda. i m considering purchasing a psvr 2  though i have been on the fence since i haven t seen a must play game yet. however i certainly won t be buying the horizon bundle now if i do end up buying psvr 2. i haven t bought a ps5 since they were very hard to get until somewhat recently and now that they are available the same dilemma is occurring in that there isn t a must play game yet. so i dunno maybe i ll just skip sony this gen  my pc is equally powerful to a ps5 anyways. i was really hyped for ff16 and ff7 remake pt 2 but i guess they ll come to pc  the better option due to mods  but i ll have to wait  ugh.
aloy goes to hollywood and turns ugly and gay. checks out. also in the canon it would make sense to make her completely asexual since she s a clone with a specific task to save the world and the woman who designed her  if she were smart  would not allow a love interest to potentially jeopardize that mission. but hey  gotta get the gay in there! because the developers are 12 years old  apparently.
they are after kratos now just because he told stories about atreus and how he was different from the rest of the spartans  trans community  is claiming that he was in love with him but he was spartan and fell victim to stereotypical spartan culture and masculinity. please leave kratos alone
the whole forbidden west game was a shout our to the power of woman. basically in the west you gain respect by being strong. which in itself is fine but in every single village with like the exception of 2.5 villages and the men in power either die or get booted out of the village  smh. the strongest warriors are women and they rule the west. it honestly breaks the immersion of the game because in real life  sure the elite woman would dominate the average man  but the elite man would dominate all. it also belittles aloys characters because apparently any woman can be super awesome. it starts to .are you feel like  well of course aloy is awesome  she s a woman and nothing more is required. minor spoiler is early on you come across melee fighting arenas and if you beat all the arenas you get to challenge the best fighter of all time. an old woman this time.  it actually gets really dumb really quick.  in the early game aloy gets everything she wants or i will throw temper tantrum and make smart remarks. no one can go into the west  its forbidden because of how dangerous it is but ally in 2minutes earns the respect of the entire forbidden west because..... yea... and its a safe place for her because everyone respects her mightyness. and of course we will follow you and help you a d we dont then i ll kill you or embarrass you. oh your a business man  ally don t like that your making profit and now your life is easier than those around the area but will help other entrepreneurs later create a business because now its ok.  blah blah.....the end.
nothing in this world suprise me
i just had a sinking feeling when i originally saw aloy while my brother was playing zero dawn that they would end up making her a lesbian. sad to see it  sony is so pathetic
i m fine with her getting a girlfriend but she definitely could do better. seyka is such a generic  pseudo-masculine stoic badass empowered wo-man  that you can almost predict everything she s about to say because it s always the generic  tough  thing to say. seyka is primarily a competitive  smug and petty person who is frankly unbearably irritating at times despite being pretty helpful in combat situations. saying things like  glad you tagged along  after letting aloy do 95  of the work doesn t strike me as charming or funny  it s just tiring because that masculine feminist stereotype is so overplayed these days  it really is
why aloy  !!!!!!!! why  !!!!!!!!
i am glad i stop playing this game and following that serie when i saw how petty they are with the elden ring insident. i am so glad i never bought the 2nd.
check out the stellar blade trailers.
yeah seika is a biological man so aloy isn t a lesbian
good time to be a nintendo gamer. samus called  she has her femininity in tact  woman of action that doesn t talk about feelings in hallways or cafes.
looks like it s going to happen to  merrin  in the up coming  jedi survivor  she was obviously attracted to cal in  jedi fallen order  which was intentional as the actors and creators said .but current day she cant be a hedro native of dethmar   she has to be a  pansexual  who during the time between  fallen order and survivor  the novel illustrates a lesbian relationship she had while on there adventures .this shows how much  current day has no talent .they made her pansexual so they leave the door open for her obvious attraction to cal from the first game  but you know they had to dip there finger in that smh .funny they wanted to put that bs in the game after the first was a success disney and company had no faith in  fallen order  it was a surprise hit to them  so the sequel is gonna be touched obviously cause of the success
this makes no sense. i played the first horizon game. not once has aloy ever showed any interest in females  like at all  much less any of the males who chase after her.i always thought aloy was and will always be similar to samus aran. asexual.unlike samus  aloy ain t even that hot  unfortunately  but she s still got game to pick her choice of a male partner.but  she aloy  showed no interest. so i assumed she was asexual like samus and bojack horseman s buddy  what s his name
just when you think you are enjoying the game and this happens
i only play horizon series for the combat and machine design. those are the only fun part of the game. everything else feels like checkboxes to appease  modern audiences
ff7 remake  that has 2 pretty good female leads.
try a game called control  great game  cool main chr
samus became the metroid  too lol metroid dread spoilers
@safer ren  that was pretty bad ass too. it created problems in fusion  and those problems were still there in dread which basically means no ice beam  no cold areas  however i ll take that to siphon life force from an enemy.
since when has samus aran ever been confirmed as  asexual  by anyone  she s never been own by any specific labels and thank goodness there s no romantic element in the series given all of her space adventures she had and experienced.
those characters have existed a long time  they don t count as new lol
considering the population of the world at the time of this game... the chances of her being gay.. yeah  they don t have time for people to be gay
aloy s cringey ass thirsty dialogue was ugh
aloy was never straight  i don t understand the surprise and why people are saying suddenly she s a lesbian  in the first game she was awkward when the king of meridian was making moves  in the 2nd game they spell it out that she s a clone of a lesbian
i played the dlc already and liiittle by litle i started to notice something weird... the evil guy is a white old rich guy  the guys are either useless or assholes  and finally well  aloy is gay... and then was like... huh... so this is in the agenda too.... why   are there no strong female characters that are straight   i guess... no...
0 00 funny enough  aloy was made ugly since the beginning. if you ve seen hannah hoekstra  whom aloy was modeled after  you ll know what i m talking about.
assassin s creed did it best with kassandra in ac odyssey imo. at least ubisoft is more creative and lets you the player choose to sleep with anyone everyone regardless of gender.
i think lot of fiction writer in general especially game is so heart broken in relationship so they invent lesbian exoticism. we must pity them.
they made all the men in this franchise weirdly milquetoast and unappealing. so it kind of makes sense that she s a lesbiano. should ve named the dlc burning loins.
i mean...as far as i ve been aware  aloy had been assumed to be bi for years  by fans  but she was just too preoccupied and poorly socialized to really do anything about it. sure  i think it s kind of pointless to put a romance in there and then say   someday we ll meet again! never forget me!  but i don t i find this aggregious.
waaaaah lesbians exist
oh no  glad i never liked the first game. the closest 2 love interests lara croft had was the soul patch guy from angel of darkness  and the jesus guy from rise of the tomb raider. but they didn t force or push anything  and that s why the series is great. she remains a lone hero. i think they just made her look older maturer as the reboot went on. me andromeda  that colossal woke disaster  remember that  they made tree female protagonist look uglier and all the characters were just a nightmare.
if it wasn t for the accuracy of the gameplay they woul ve made her obese.
it s almost like if you don t like you don t need to play it......omg what a concept
i m glad that i skipped over this series. i m sticking with older games  shows  and movies into the woke phase passes.
knowing sony  peter parker   miles morales will probably kiss at the end of spiderman 2
aloy is quite possibly the most annoying protagonist in any video game. she is sour  deliberately mean  narcissistic  and her constant attempts at  jokes  are cringe
like whats next  naughty dog gonna make chloe and nadine change sexuality too
sony is somehow still number one while shooting themselves in the foot consistently  goes to show how awful microsoft is lol.
it blows my mind that you have all these opinions about a game you never even played. there was nothing  woke  about the main game and your buddy critical drinker gave the game a rave review without mentioning  wokeness  because  it wasn t.  in fact he stated people were making much to do about nothing on her.  so the point in contention here then  is the dlc.  but the mere existence of gay people in a movie game doesn t automatically make it woke.  it depends on how it s written  how natural forced it feels.  this was a subtle build up done slowly  and respectfully. there was nothing preachy or unnatural about it. but you wouldn t know that since you never played the game.  this reminds me of when someone wears a band shirt for a band they never even listened to  we call that being a poser.  you also say you  love  the first game but then are upset about aloy lacking feminine traits. which  if you actually remembered  she grew up a tomboy with no mother figure or feminine influence in the first place  so of course she s going to be lacking awkward in that department.   critical drinker actually puts logic in his thoughts   you just put your fingers in your ears shouting  woke  indiscriminately at everything   like they say  when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail.
ummm none of us thought she was bi. at most  she was a solo person who would never have a romance.
@zero todona  i dunno  i m suppose reporting on what i ve seen floating around when i m looking up fanart for horizon. i see so much of it  i thought it might be a fandom majority line of thinking. i can be wrong
listen to me  if a character doesn t have a canonical straight relationship partner  the fandoms will always want to ship them to someone from the same sexit has always been like this  you rarely see a big non canon ship that is straight unless the game builds some kind of chemistry between two characters of the same sex without romance.examples  male robin and chrom even thought chrom canonically has a biological daughter   miles edgeworth and phoenix wright  bayonetta and jeanne and there goes.
@safer ren  i m aware that it s always been like this. even if a character is canonically straight has a straight partner- people still ship them with someone of the same sex. heaven forbid you do that to an explicitly gay character  but the argument isn t hypocrisy at this point.my point was  there have been plenty of people who thought this way for a while. it s a pointless romance  but it s not something that seems to have come out of the blue.
i regret purchasing this dlc now
this actually only bothers me in post-apocalyptic fiction  because... you have to produce more humans. gay is kinda like a luxury.
i guess the new spider-man game will have peter be gay too now
it s so important that this fictional character have a sexuality  we need to be sure to stress to naysayers how unimportant the sexuality of a fictional character is!disagree with me on my own grounds and i ll be sure you know how ridiculous those grounds are!wait....i mean....
nothing like going ahead and unnecessarily ruining perfectly good stories with deviant practices. time for the world to go back to how it was.
guess i won t be buying the expansion.
this only adds to the wisdom of only buying games after all its dlc was released and there have been no bullshit woke drama. who knows if hogwarts will add woke dlc  at least people can chose to to buy dlc  but then youre getting an incomplete game experience.
you can choose to say no. which is what i did  because it just didn t seem to fit her character at all.
after  zero dawn    forbidden west  was quite disappointing.  the writing wasn t as good.  the plot was a laughable mess.  they nerfed melee.  made upgrades more cumbersome.   i m not really looking forward to this dlc. i might pick it up on sale. the dlc for  zero dawn  wasn t that good.  it lacked tension. there wasn t much reason to finish it. i didn t hate  forbidden west  but  it s not something i d play twice. it just wasn t that memorable. i ve been through  zero dawn  at least 3 times.   didn t like what they did to an mc i really liked.  aloy seemed pretty whiny in the new one.
forbidden west is a good game. of course they have the obligatory trans characters  the men all seem incompetent and the women all too butch.... but gameplay wise it s solid. haven t played the burning shores  but i have it installed.
so the gay of us wasn t enough.... now this.
joanna dark better be hot in the new game or i m gonna be upset.
samus aran
i really love this dlc  but why did guerrilla decide to make her gay aloy is such a strong character  and she is such an idol for playstation   but making her go through this path will really ruin the way people play the game   the game at this moment is being review bombed because of these gay lesbian and lgbtq  practices and i don t really blame them to an extent  i felt the same way in tlou and i don t feel any different in horizon  this agenda doesn t make this game any better   it just makes it unpleasant.i really hope guerrilla listens to the community and leaves out these nonsense practices.
i love how leftists act like two men or two women can t just be friends. it has to be a gay relationship. every time.
that s why i don t play american games anymore  i buy mostly japanese games and some european too but mostly japanese.
1 30 yes......in their japanese games. there  women are still allowed to be visually beautiful and likable as characters and we ll written. the woke alfabet filth is usually reserved for western audiences. not sure why you guys keep buying them.
holy shit sony drank the woke cool aid real hard. like they chugged the whole thing with zero gag reflex and then swallowed the bottle too. just wait until kratos gets cucked and sidelined by freya in the god of war ragnarok sequel.
thank god  we have modder. maybe some modder has the guts to gender-swap the side character to a male. why not  same right for everyone.
you guys do realize that the romance is optional  the three options are  yes    not yet   and  no.  if you don t want aloy to be with seyka  just don t pick those options.
you know there s millions of other games out there . right
with crystal dynamics working on it  don t get your hopes up. the concepts already show her in a basic pair of jeans with a boxy jacket. a far cry from the jo we know and love
@melonie mac go boom  preparing for disappointment then....
rost was the og chad.
was going to buy this game. avoiding it totally now.
most women aren t gay.i know that s shocking  but it s true.  being a  strong  lesbian that don t need no man is the new damsel in distress  it s cliche as fuck.just look at ellie in lou  or seven of nine in picard  the upcoming tomb raider reboot  the willow series  new mutants movie  black cat  harley quinn  poison ivy  cat woman  and so many others.for whatever reason  entertainment today hates the idea of straight women.  unless said straight woman is in a toxic relationship waiting to be saved by a lesbian  then it s ok.
melonie  please make a video about the diablo 4 female fat druid. it s disgusting they say it is a game about choice but looks just hideous and ugly. i m not fat shaming  but it s real dumb looking. you can make a fat character appealing but they did everything to make her so no self respecting person would play as.
remember   if a brand new character is gay that automatically makes it bad.
i wouldn t really care about aloy being a lesbian but between the fact they made her uglier and less conventionally in the second game and the fact the second game apparently tried to add more modern socio-politics into a post-apocalyptic game this doesn t feel organic at all and just a tactic to stir clout and earn woke points.
i declined the advance  my aloy not gay
i couldn t care less about aloy and her lack of personality. the only interesting character on horizon was sylens. rest in peace  mr. lance.
sorry folks but the game was woke from the first game. i saw this miles away when the 1st game came out.
what gets me is that the hollywood sign would in no shape and form still be there. it s been what  100s of years since the collapse of  modern  humans  i just don t see it still be standing. yes  i m triggered about a f ing sign. xd
the answer is simple. vote with your wallet. i enjoyed zero dawn a lot. seeing this  i m skipping the sequel. the game simply wasn t made for me. good luck to whoever this was built for. enjoy your game. i ll politely pass.
are your arms always cold but you shoulders are always hot
why are developers so afraid of attractive women  you notice it more and more how ugly or just meh women have become in entertainment. what s hilarious is that they still make so many of them gay. news flash women who are attracted to women  like attractive women. not dumpy  hairy women. if they wanted someone chubby and hairy they d date a trucker. i got horizon zero dawn for dirt cheap  like  12. and that was because i kept hearing both how good and how woke it was. and it was  the main character is a literal chosen one. who s a clone of a woman who saved the world. so the woman who saved the world cloned herself to save the world......egomania much. now in this game we have aloy constantly belittling or insulting male characters. female characters are constantly shown in positions of power and authority despite the massive physical disadvantage they have over men in a primitive society. what s weird is that in this game we start off in a snowy cold environment. an environment where fat would be crucial  aloy however is very fit her cheeks are thin clearly showing how little fat meat she has on her. forbidden west is set after the first game. in a hotter more tropical location. and aloy has put alot of weight on. her cheeks have more than doubled in size. again. this shows how much fat she has on her. now. why would a character have more fat on them after going from a cold environment into a hotter one  because the devs wanted aloy to be less attractive which is why she looks even less like the actress she s modelled after who is very attractive. western entertainment keeps making women ugly. despite how many of these women are now gay. sorry lesbians now it s your turn to be told you have to find someone ugly attractive i guess.  of the 2 which do you think is larger. the men who want to see 2 girls get it on. women who want to see a man and woman get it on. yeah. wanna guess how few men still want that  when even the guys who only want to see a female protag get with another woman start saying stop. maybe re-evaluate even hbo s tlou adaptation made ellie uglier  bella did a great job but still  i m not getting with someone from burning shore. that s just asking for infection. holy shit i just realised. by making every female protag gay. they re saying straight women can t do shit. i mean that s the logic of why we didn t have female protags before right  because women couldn t do it  whelp now it s just you know. 90  of women i guess.  i m not surprised aloy has a hero complex or that her new gf is ethnic. just hit all the boxes. unattractive woman  check. gay  check. savior  check. ethnically diverse love interest  check. zero relatability for gamers  check. ok let s get this trainwreck on the road.
not just a another woman as the love interest  a person of color as well like we have seen in recent media so they can tick the racial diversity box as well.
amazing how regularly people complain about a game they haven t even played yet.  i don t know what this game is about but it has x in it so it must be bad  not that i entirely disagree with your points but i still highly recommend playing the game first because there s a lot more to it than woke and lgbt.
i think sony is now based in san francisco. that should explain a lot.
i don t care if characters are lesbian  but if that s part of the character  do it from the beginning or not at all. i won t buy this dlc partially because i deleted the game a year ago once i completed it. this just feels weird. dlc came a year late and i don t care for this really
i would disagree that it s more natural for men to be heroes. not that i agree with making them all part of the alphabet either.
glad the ugly treatment had not hit bayonetta yet  because ya know they looking to get her soon
everything went downhill after he died
@melonie mac go boom  imagine how much more of an awesome father figure he would ve been if we saw more of his adopted father-daughter relationship.
@melonie mac go boom  getting the whole backstory of his death seeker quest was great storytelling despite being an exposition dump.
i m literally the same way. i was considering getting this game if i get a ps5  but now i m not. i feel like playstation in general is going downhill.
heavens forbid you start a conversation about the ridiculousness of this being added to the plot and you just get hit with the  why do you care so much  as a response.
cut off the hair and the love interest looks a lot more like aang  the last air bender. smh
horizon was only good in the first game  after that it was downhill.
the last of us treatment. then gonna do re re  re-remake release and include this like as if she always was.just in time for pride toostraight females as main characters are a dying breed. if not that  then they get the bayonetta 3 treatment. where the writers and game director chooses the joke lame character as the main love option. rodin was there but niggas always get shafted for the lack of rizz in these games.i still to see a nigga in a game with the legendary rizz unlocked. in game not fanfic black baron  maybe  help me out  guys and girls...
lmao. you literally have a choice not to engage and leave aloy single. so many snowflakes in the comments.
aloy is not attractive  somewhat unlikeable and now a lesbian.  the gameplay better be outstanding.  the developers should have given the player romance options with both sexes  as is common in rpgs  but that isn t woke enough.
wait...someone that never had a mother  real father  or real love interest almost all of her life turned into a lesbian  wow...color me surprised.
i m just glad the uncharted series is mostly over before sony  and cuckman  could screw it up completely.
another great series ruined by the idea that modern games need to all be woke. this disappoints me sooooo much because i loved horizon. sigh
nooo not lara croft  she s suppose to be like the straightest bad ass female character.
i think the reason why you say aloy is  ugly  is because you re actually prettier than her  so your benchmark is high if you use yourself as the reference point. not that it s a bad thing. it s understandable. personally  i do not find aloy unattractive. she s above average in my opinion  i try to be objective on this . and this goes for both versions of her  zero dawn and forbidden west . i do admit that her face looks bloated on the trailer screenshots that you showed  but trust me  she doesn t look like that in-game. probably  guerilla corrected it after the trailer got a backlash. i do agree with your point about the numbers of lesbians or progressive people that are actually gamers. are they big enough in numbers that they can vouch for such a type of female protagonist  hard to say  but if we d go by statistics  zero dawn sold 20 million copies. i believe forbidden west sold 10 million. nier automata only sold 7.5 million. i m not sure if any tomb raider game sold over 20 million as of now. granted that sony has all the marketing prowess to promote the horizon franchise  that s still a lot of sales. i m personally fine with making aloy a lesbian. she s a blank slate so basically  they can do whatever they want with her. now  if they make lara croft a lesbian  that s another story. i do like attractive female protagonists myself  though that doesn t mean i won t be playing aloy or ellie because they cater to a different crowd. i do suggest that you give forbidden west a try. it s a gorgeous game. it s not like they ll make a new triple-a tomb raider soon  so while waiting  you may wanna give that one a chance.
back to lara croft
i figured the new horizon would do something stupid like this.  that s why i won t buy it.  pretty much any mainstream modern game is an instant non-buy.  because i refuse to support their nonsense.
this is another reason why the mass effect games are better.
remember the twitter outrage when bayonetta turned out to be straight
now  i m guessing  burning shores  is a double entendre. this is so bunk. i really loved the first game but yeah i m with you i couldn t finish the sequel. this is like  the last if us  gay backstory dlc. maybe  they think  this will appeal to men who think think they re women audience.
and earlier they bitched about elden ring stealing their spotlight
i checked out of horizon after forbidden west anyway. they wrote aloy to be an insufferable  strong wamen  with a savior complex  and it was clear what direction they were going at that point.shame  i loved the first game  i gave trhe second game a chance despite initial impressions  but i am done with this series. keep your agenda driven dlc sony  not interested.
this presentation is misleading  play the game yourself  then critique.apparently  the gay path is an option in the dlc. it s still ridiculous that guerrilla took this path with such a rockin character. as long as there s no  over the rainbow  trophy  i ll still sleep at night.
google   aloy nikocado avocado
lol i commented on this before finishing the video  but yeah. forbidden west is exactly what you expect it to be.
when the first game was being developed  sony was afraid that a lead female character wouldn t have a good public reception  and now we have a lesbian lead character  what a trip.
burning bushes.
wait for the pc version with mods to restore her appearance from hzd.
hear me out  just hear me out  as a dude if i have to play a female character in 2023  i dont wanna have to get intimate as the character with some dude. honestly the only real solution is to make aloy not have relationships. why does every character have to have a romantic relationship  i ve never gotten that. its usually the slowest part of any video game story. the only reason people liked it in mass effect 3   including me   is because they re damn degenerates and they wanted to make boom boom with the blue poon. other than that does anybody really care about relationships in video games besides like friendships and family  does anything really hold as much weight  more than the action you could be having in game
i m not gonna lie  i m new here but judging by your appearance alone one would think you would ve taken the opposite stance on this  woke  thing. no offence but literally every girl i ve ever known with an arm sleeve full of tats is woke  or at least gay bi to a degree. and i mean literally every last one. i mean at this point the only thing you re missing is the septum piercings and blue hair to complete the woke female gamer uniform lol
the only strong sony female lead returnal s selene. and thank ffff we have control s jesse faden.
gonna have to pass on this
i m not sure what the issue is  it s a game character.  who cares   beyond that  how is this a shocker   the original was a lesbian.  she was involved with the main bad character in forbidden west.maybe it s my woke nature but for a woman to say being a hero is a male trait is surprisingly misogynistic.  the ability to recognize the right thing and be willing to do it is all it takes to be a hero.  it s not a male trait.  we ve had the female in distress trope for far too long.we need to grow up as a society and just allow an imaginary character to fall in love with whomever they choose.  their sex should be irrelevant.
samus is better anyway. metroid dread is amazing
do you think is the reason  writers  do this
like gears 1 didn t really have romance  just bros shooting locusts. happy days. now if they did a reboot theyd probably make dom and marcus love each other romantically.. its just awful
ah so your talking about games you haven t played awesome
thanks sony  i will save 80 .
so it was all pointless      why waste time making aloy lesbian or bisexual  give one kiss and then bye forever....so stupid. i love the og dragon age where you pick your romance option and journey with them the whole game....also the original mass effect.....honestly  this  romance  with awful writing from what you read is pointless and akin to nothing......if i am playing an action rpg style game i just wanna journey and have fun....if i want a romance  i will play stardew  portia  or some jrpgs with romance options!
i stopped playing forbidden west half way through  it just got repetitive and boring.
why do they feel the need to make all strong female characters into lesbians
why cant you guys apreciate all the female characters out there   who arent lgbt. but only focus on the few lgbt ones which dont even exceed 5.i only know ellie and maybe one in life is strange game   now aloy  which is maybe not even canon    it is not even that much but you guys act like it is everywhere because you only focus on that this is scary.as a gay man  and a gamer   if i ever get the chance to make a game  i know that the main character would be gay   i would want to tell a story i can relate to.but then people will call it woke   when it is not the intention.....strange...focus on something else guys stop calling anything woke ....
lmao. i dont play this game but i saw one clip of those to just talking and i said to myself  they re probably lesbians.
horizon clearly dislikes men.  for every amazing woman in the story there is a disappointing man.  the men are either villainous  subservient  or flawed to the point of pathetic  while women make things happen  with their distinctly masculine traits .  for a story with great sci fi ideas  they sure fumbled the characters in this sense.  too bad.
the over representation is at insane levels. how many sony exclusive games have lesbian protagonists now
they stole the look from the original gamer girls lol
@swang gang  did they though  i wouldn t say so. the original gamer girls are nerds  that weren t  the  hot  kind of nerds  and who didn t care so much about fashion nor aesthetics. i grew up with many.
@johann sebastian bach  honestly i was just joking
both are very forgettable character tbh  i liked them but they don t have the iconic power of lara croft or even original aloy. they just look like npc s who got their own games
@melonie mac go boom  selene loosing her child  being stuck in perpetual hell  and slowly as you get better at the game  she becomes the most dangerous thing on the planet. jesse confronting her wild past  gaining power  earning respect as new director i dunno  i think they re both pretty bad ass. and the way thay they play move and fight  reminds me of the old school tomb raider days. i knew when i started that game up i was going to pop the ffff off
aloy is a lesbian  stunning and brave.
i am a guy and i like these games.
@daniel hoover  i am also a guy  and i also like these games  but my valid criticism remains!
not been a fan of horizon woke dawn since the beginning. the strong neo-feminist  misandrist   matriarchal vibes were just too grating for me to bare.     all the women portrayed as wise  and strong. while all the men were made out to be weak  incompetent fools  evil monsters  or both..         nice graphics  and the gameplay seemed alright... but simply too much woke cringe. shame.
youve got to be freaking kidding me.
to be honest  maybe you should be pissed  but maybe not for the reason you are thinking. i think its something else  not woke actually  maybe the opposite of woke. playstation knows their audience is mostly dudes and if they were to make her straight and say  get banged by a dude  that would be pretty gross for most guys  so making her a lesbian is kind of playing it safe actually. similar thing to ellie actually  sure abby got banged by a guy  but everyone just hated her  probably didnt help the fight for straight female leads.
the last aaa game i truly enjoyed was ghost of tsushima. i m glad i didn t spend a single dime on this perv garbage. i m done with new games. they can keep this sh!t  i ll play old games from a sane world that no longer exists.
i mean  playing the first game  i could already tell where this studio was going. incompetent males  besides the dad   and all the females had to step up and fix things. this isn t even surprising...
aren t you guys tired of being called conspiracy theorists when in fact you have become complete experts on the predictable behavior of leftists btw  why not hook up aloy with that black guy who you meet early on in the game  varl  it is obvious that guy likes aloy and aloy has some feelings for him  nope  gotta talk all strong independent wahman who don t need no man into a lesbo. boring  predictable  and stale.
i don t really care all that much that her  love interest  is another woman  i m much more irritated that it s a  one scene at the end of the story  deal. poorly written  poorly executed  poorly received. if the story doesn t have a romance  built in   then don t push one in later  the players will decide who they want to pair game characters too.
the whole series is woke. the machines were created because climate change was ruining the world. then of course a rich white man uses the machines for war and causes the apocalypse. the savior is a lesbian scientist. everything about the series is woke
i m very okay with this. i don t want the character i m playing to be romancing some dude. the only thing i dislike is how homely they ve made aloy  though she never was a looker .
da fuq having a strong female character isn t enough    this is creepy  and i don t respect it in my games.  i just came from watching some gaming competitions from florida and speedrunning channels - the they them cult is going strong and insidiously infecting gaming culture.it s like ordering a perfectly cooked and seasoned steak and the store manager tell you it s gonna come smeared with a1 and you can t ask them not to add the a1 and ruin the steak
0 24 oh god please no
yo why don t people request refund for them changing the game so its not what you payed for then when they don t sue them. i mean you don t buy a shoe then they send you. coat
thanks for letting us know.....i won t be purchasing this dlc.....sick people
well what can i say... writers want their strong females to be as man as possible so they write them lesbian.
aloy will have bulge in the next game for sure
second game title has her with one masculine face  bottom jawline is something else
who doesnt like looking at pretty people
not only uglier  but they made her unlikeable in the sequel too
i rather our video games go woke i know it s annoying but i don t want barny or dora to or any kids show to go woke then we re screwed
i don t mind gay stuff in media  but in this game  it felt so shoehorned in and forced. like there was little to no buildup to them even liking each other to begin with. dlc was cool  but this just took me out of the game for a bit
guerilla games is what you get when you order bungee from wish
dam i wish she woulda been with eren or nil
so they pulled a tlou  poor errand.
shouldn t we be happy the abs are gone seeing as that s what you d typically find on males  so on one hand we complain that females aren t more feminine then on the other when they give her a more feminine stomach we complain.
i hated how they ruined aloy just to make a statement. why does everyone have to be gay
haven t even watced the video yet. but just because they did this woke crap in the games dlc i don t plan on ever playing it. it s one thing to let you choice between a group of people or no one for thw story it s another to push a agenda.
aloy s model was beautiful. hzd aloy was... fine  hfw aloy is straight homely. just like ellie. homely and rough.
the good thing about this is that it s dlc. we can simply not buy it. i ain t got time for this nonsense. i have the game which i love but won t touch the dlc.
i don t play those games and never purchase the skins in fortnite.
bruh... i just want to enjoy videogames and not get this shit on my face with every game... i m just playing gran turismo and soon to play only forza motorsport 8...man is so tiresome.
gonna play devil s advocate here  but this is not going woke  but adding fan service to the target market... i don t know a single straight guy that picks a male love interest  that doesn t secretly question their sexuality ... they always pick the lesbian romance option when playing a female protagonist...
ugh .i m so sick of this  it makes me so mad  they re ruining all the best characters with this literal trash.
funny how i was thinking about this yesterday. what recent female protagonists are just straight  can you imagine kratos being gay
wait until you find the transgender npc they just thrown in there on a side quest.
home is not a place. it s a person or and people.
what about wonder women ! maybe she should be bi and lara croft should be bi
there s no agenda. none at all. also true heroes never want to be one.
hey melonie you misspelled  girlfriend  in the thumbnail for the video
bruh!! she was feeling avad the sun king wtf happen to tha she was suppose to go back... this suck i dnt wanna play the dlc anymore
what s a lesbian s favorite cerial  carpet crunch   d
that many fans of the classic do not like lara croft is understood and even if she does not look the same  but to say that she is ugly is totally false  do not tell lies that she does not have an exuberant body  if it is true  but at the present time where everything is it stylizes it is understandable what i do not share is that they make her homosexual and very different from aloy she was beautiful in part 1 and in part 2 they made her fat and ugly.
i ll not buy any new games this woke stuff needs to stop
this is exactly why i don t play american games anymore.
what s next kratos in the god of war will be attracted to men  or maybe his son atreus. it is to much now.
thank you for being pretty
just like the last of us s add on  left behind   an excuse to take a character that was presumed to be straight because of her actions in the base game  and turn her into a lez in the add on.guess i won t be getting any more horizon games.
is the first game worth it
wait a little longer and in the next dlc we will find out that it is actually a man who identifies as a woman.i can only say one thing. don t buy that shit anymore.
i am all for gay rights as long as both chicks are hot.
go woke go broke.
all lesbians and nft s  what could go wrong  this bud s for you!
if y all are only figuring this out now then you re simply not paying attention. can anyone name any female lead successful ip where the lead female is straight  go on... i ll wait
won t purchase the dlc. will save my money that isn t woke. have an extra  20 for diablo 4.
tbh  the arc plot isnt woke actually in this case  if you follow the whole story plot. and also aloy is beautiful imo...they made her real  atomical and unexagerated  as vgs  like to flip around too often  also it is a apocalyptic world  was refreshing to me. devs even stated they didnt want a overly and ridiculously unrealistic model girl  they wanted pretty but avarage overall. now  getting back  think about it  lis is lesbian  tilda her ex lover stated so in game...aloy is a clone of lis  a genetic clone...now i wont go into the impossible of memories or them being  the same through and through   or that just because lis was lesbian  so was aloy or even beta inevitably...too open ended and they are all individually themselves. could a case of reincarnated chance  deja vu  be spoken of...who knows. and yes  just like in the past with lis  and her mission  aloy was created to fulfil that same mission. now  the devs didnt just make her  gay  over night  they planted the seed in dawn with her repeated awkward shuffle away from the flirting and praise from male characters. fw they introduced her blushing at petra and vanasha remarks  as well as talahnah praise among other encounters  dont forget the repeated boob abs glances from aloy in convos with the later two and her opening up more to women then her male companions. now was the relationship brought on suddenly  yes  was it dropped uncontextually from the sky  no. was it needed  no...was the asking of a relationship for her brought on so much they caved  possibly. but also i didnt mind the nice pace change and good brought for her in the dlc  shes had a very rough go one thing after the other  a refreshment was needed. something happy  and light. and it was left open ended  if seyka comes back joins her of stays undetermined  so be it. but in the end the clone stance  the tells in the 2 main games...and in a way sticking true to curent and secondary plot with lis and aloy...it was very smart and a bit genius of them to do it this way  something different as well. so what if by chance aloy and ellie  pss biggest female characters are gay. it just so happens to align with a  certain talking point in time .  just a different take and what i saw from the plot going where it did.  rushed  yes. but if you looked hard and pay attention to all aspects of the plot and canon lore...it was smart. do disagree with the  ugliness  tho  she is gorgeous and badass! im  fine either way whether they give her a li  or even with a girl or boy or anything...i just though the overall detil the devs gave to aloy possibly brought on by lis was a savvy touch.
oh jesus christ!
this shouldn t have been a surprise to anyone. almost every npc in forbidden west is gay. i ve love horizon for years  i m now done with the franchise and the studio  after they drowned the game with  the message.
this is why playstation got kicked out of jampan.
is sony s fat princess lesbian was well or has she been canceleed in fears of fatphiobia
nick avocado strikes again! the game did treat every male character like crap. i just want killzone to come back already.
it s so fricking tiring
lesbian in a post apocalyptic tribal society
same here. japanese games  1st party and 3rd party  and nintendo s consoles only.
i loved the first game and the 2nd was pretty good  but now i won t be buying the 3rd game when it comes out.
@ilya kats  good to know
nope.
guess i wont be playing the third game!  her sexuality s was not mention in the first game should have stayed that way
they just can t help themselves smdh  another ip i ll no longer be supporting  these people must really hate money.
aloy goes to the ruins of california and becomes homosexual.  confirmed  it s an environmental hazard  possibly something in the water.
digital fat suit...
wait wait wait.are they forcing us  didn t we get  love  reject  smart  options for the original game my god. guess i ll speak with my wallet. huge discount or 0.
just beacuse her gene mother was lesbian does mean aloy should be it  aloy look like elizabeth sobeck  but they have different personality.
i m not buying that they can keep it where the sun don t shine
at least rule 34 will have more content i guess
welp. even if i got a ps5 i m ditching horizon  forbidden west. i played zero dawn on ps4 and was ecstatic at forbidden west. what the fuck
10 30 this has gotta be sarcasm right
i was planning to buy the ps5 just to get the 3rd game when it comes out  but now sony and guerrilla won t get any money from me. screw them.
@ilya kats  i don t blame you it s time to stop giving people who hate you and your values  your hard earned money... i had bought the ps4 version and also when i had the opportunity to finally buy a ps5 it was the horizon bundle   side note i think they bundled them together to boost the sale of the game but that might just be me over thinking this lol   i gave the code to a friend still i haven t got around to playing it and with this i don t even know if i ever will  knowing where their going with it  man i really enjoyed the first one the music the story the robo dino fights  for crying out loud i m not hard to please just don t beat me over the head with your propaganda is that too much to ask
idk i always thought she was a lesbain. the weird part is she develops this relationship with some fuckin rando after seeming to intentionally avoid relationships with other people in her group. i honestly don t know why people are surprised she s gay. unless they ve just never played the games  which it s obvious many of the people complaining have not.
played zero dawn but won t bother with the new game.
fictional character is lesbian anti woke mob  reeeeee
i did not like forbidden west.too long  too many dide quests and varls death was pointless.the end boss fight also sucked.
not every playstation character has to be lesbian  they are killing the ips  they ll find out
1 24 great question  sony some answer please
you do get a choice in the end of the dlc. heart  brains or fist. choosing fist to outright reject her and the relationship. that s what i did and i was like cool.
@axelay523  thanks dude. i ll still wait for a discount.i don t mean to sound bitter. but it does sting a bit when my  heart choices  with the characters of horizon 1 are super tame while a 1 dlc character gets the spotlight.
@jose tomas campos robledano  no problem and i m sure it ll go on sale eventually like frozen wilds did.
give them all the bud light treatment...i know not to get the dlc now...nobody asked for this...  and this is coming from a guy who s favorite dq11 character is silvando   all of his female characters in swtor are roast beef sammich eaters..
lol scissor
why is everyone pissed off that she s gay bisexual  elizabeth sobek wasn t heterosexual  so it makes sense. secondly she isn t  ugly   she looks more like a normal woman girl.
power rangers has gay couples in it!
no. its facts
@sup  i don t play tomb raider  that s the lara croft game right idk see how clueless i am   but one of them is a pixelated pokey triangle thing and the other a pretty lady i think y all are blinded by nostalgia with that one lol
aloy and ellie are both lesbians in a post apocalyptic setting where they both play a  prophet  role where they can t reproduce  i hope aloy is at least bi.
we need a vaccine for this rainbow virus
glad i never really got into this series.
that writing sounds like middle school fan fiction
i m done with horizon
aloy is gay by the way   drinker voice
same here. not because of the whole lesbian issue  but because the game is not as good as zelda breath of the wild or even the upcoming tears of the kingdom.
get ready for zelda tears of the kingdom.
@kevin ramirez  i might go through and play all the zelda series
i just don t like them making them ugly looking!
this obsession with sex is disturbing. can t we just have games and comic books and movies without any romantic relationships  i m sure the next transformers movie will make a transformer gay.
this is disgusting  it was meant to be alloy and errand  he was cleaning his act up and all  and the worst bit is just before you do the dlc she holds errands necklace close to her heart and talks about how she misses him................but then suddenly lesbians.............like what the hell  this is straight erasure for sure
jesus  did neil cuckmann write this game   ugh.
i admit that  even as a guy  i ve never found anything appealing about lesbians. i m not offended or grossed out or anything  but i find it difficult to be turned on by someone who doesn t value what i would bring to the table.
at this point had she been straight i would have been surprised.
hence why gowr   elden ring were superior
could tell she was les just by the way she spoke to men  from the first game.
oh wells.
glad i don t have ps
get identity politics out of my games.
there s avad or eren ffs. enough with this bs.
love how straight women are like unicorns now  real fun
the worst thing about forbidden west is that it is incredibly boring.
to be fair idk anyone excited for this game. idk anyone excited about the first 2
the right wing need to launch a anti-woke campaign on girl on girl action in porn films.
glad i didn t buy the dlc .
i hope they don t do this with lara croft.
you know what sucks we don t know if this is woke or this is just an option . assassin creed odyssey had this didn t matter if you are alexios or kassandra your relationships can be male or female .
gay and interracial  for the extra woke points
was she reading a lesbian fan fiction
thats why i always love to play japanese made games  western games especially us are always gay
i just hate this so much in video games. just finished last of us couple weeks back on pc  everything was nice and bam they hit us with ellie is gay. i know lou 2 becomes even worse in that aspect  sad how this industry is turning out to be.
a lesbian character  how revolutionary!  what is this 1970
the leaks suggest they will  unless they changed something. made a video on it last year
i hate how they keep doing this  i played tomb raider up till shadow of the tomb  even rhona mitra s version  lara deserves jonah     @melonie mac go boom
apparently you can say no  but i think for the 3rd game she will be a full blown lesbian.
i m so tired of this developers  just like the last of us 2 .tell them to stop just stop
shame!!!
maybe she is bisexual.
little by little they will change every thing of human nature it a war agains logic
ahhh sony...  why they gotta make the 10  the 100  always   it s cliche  unnecessary and getting old now tbhcan we just get a normal game series like we used to without all this woke pull in  just want a based game without all this drama crap
forced lesbian romance yet again. just great
arrrrre you kidding me... i won t be purchasing this now... not because she went woke... but the fact of no choice in choosing my own love interest is what is killing this for me. and being forced into another gay relationship strictly for dei points.  ugh.  so over this narrative.  catering to the 10  of the population is more important than the 90  makes sense.. anheuser busch  is learning the downfall of that choice right now.
apparently  to be a brave strong women you must be a lesbian.
so any women with  agency  have to be snatch munchies nowadays i m not against a few but this obvious media prejudice is just another slap in the face to the millions of women who exist that are strong and self reliant etc. if i were a lady i would be disgusted by this bullshit at this point.having a few characters go that route is fine because some people do. but making it the only possible option is an insult.
maybe there s some foundation to why some people call the playstation  the gaystation
if we wanted to read the news we would do it ourselves. all you do is read the articles for us. of what use are your videos
i m very distracted..
next horizon game  aloy gets retconned into being a black woman.
@meloniemacgoboom
i thought aloy liked varl. why do they need to always make female leads lesbian  and why do they always make lesbians ugly
hello spicy pokimane
well aloy looks like a man anyway so it doesn t really look like a lesbian kiss
yea with a face of  nicacado afocado i cant even play the game
strong woman can t ve straight in media.the disappointment continues.
i m so tired of this.
can t get attention if you aren t woke.
is this a desperate attempt to get people to play since it tanked horribly
i wish they added gendertransitions ingame.
12 43 she looks like the fat hair haired kid from billy madison.
never played it. never will now.
ik people dislike the  tr reboots but in the rise of the tomb raider lara has more chemistry with jacob than anyone lmao how can she be a lesbian     just because weirdos want to taint a straight girl who doesn t show romantic interest in anyone for the most part lol..strong female character lesbo i guess
the first horizon zero was one of my favorite games on ps4. glad i didn t get more of it after that. all this woke garbage is just disappointingly predictable and bad. i m off to pc superiority now. ps5 can suck eggs.
i loved zero dawn and couldn t make it through forbidden west. horrible  long winded  over emotional dialogue with annoyingly cringe characters. i got to the point that i would just skip all the dialogue and cut scenes. after about 40 hours i deleted it. thank god i didn t pay for it.
i haven t bought a sony console since de ps3 because of shit like this.
i saw this coming  why  just stopped playing the game  ruined it for me  don t need sex or current political views in games  if this carries on will boycott future horizon games. they ll make her a transgender or black next time  why can t people just make playable games without their own agendas in them
men and women are more beautiful when they re together. changing that dynamic is a hideous perversion.
i won t be getting this dlc it s sucks because   forbidden west  was an ok game but for a few cringy parts.
wtf are you talking about  aloy in forbidden west is more uglier than aloy in zero dawn  what   did you play the game
so a white woman from the midwest moves to la and turns gay  yeah that is probably the most realistic thing about the game.
aloy is gay.........why am i not surprised they did this. i think female game leads nowadays are allergic to being straight.and from what i ve heard it wasn t even written well  according to people.and i think they also did it for ashly burch  since she came out as bisexual.
not buying it simple as that.
goes woke  horizon has always been super woke. i couldnt even finish the first one because of all the woke stuff  female leads in each tribe  beta dumb males  every villain was a man and white.pls....pls....if you think horizon just got woke recently  you are actually part of the woke problem
hated aloy from day 1. called it loudly since day 1. normies need to open their eyes and play the abundance of other games out there.
not only that  but you see female characters featured in all western games being made  ugly  looking. while some female characters in japanese games are being altered by their clothes from their original games  ada wong  ashley  tifa   their chest size  any sort of body features  etc  and are being censored.
yeah  they basically made aloy look more   butch.  not an attractive look at all.
you vill like the gayzyou vill eat ze bugz
it annoyed me they did this. she rebuffed all suiters in both games and suddenly becomes gay. she sould have atleast been bi and let the players choose. i bet ashley birch took the character hostage  every character ive ever heard of her playing became gay.
last of us  did the same thing. lead female character is straight until the dlc  then suddenly lesbian.
loooool omg
boycott the game.this game is not made for people like us  so dont play it  dont stream it  dont buy it.
fat aloy  ....
rumor has it nintendo is going to make samus trans... transhuman.
when i played the game in early 2022 i also noticed ukrainian flags on certain walls with hearts next to them. game is great but this political garbage needs to stop.
i think you can make her like too guys it s kind like mass effect
this is why i ve given up on playstation and xbox  nintendo is the way.
the next god of war game  the kid grows up  dyes his hair pink  and comes out as gay. also i think the woman on woman male fantasy is dying  definitely not a turn on for me  not since maybe i was a teenager  anyone else relate
i don t think sony cares about you man  they making the third horizon game...
extreme weirdo energy in this video   comment section....
sorry erend
first it was the last of us lc now it s horizon forbidden west lc    lc lesbian content  because there s definitely no d .
she started out woke  every white man in those games is evil or incompetent. they had one decent one and killed him instantly. they didn t even wait until the first dlc.
big l for sony playstation
it is not a male fantasy  it is pure propaganda  d and yes  with the ps5 only  making aloy more ugly  baffles my mind lol wtf
good thing i stopped playing this at hzd and dlc.....im done with this game
love intrests is somthing that may happen imo even thesame gender... however ... keep it on the low... just hearing you reed all the  smootchy   stuff makes me sick. so if the game is pushing things im not confortable with then im not gonna play...if you want a lesbian story go get life is strange. its a good story. but keep all the love intrest stuff on the low in a gameplay driven story.
this is absolutely inexcusable!! wth is wrong with these demonic game developers!!
oh no how dare a character be gay
why is this woman so upset over something that doesn t affect her at all  1. you can choose to skip it.2. she s the clone of a bisexual woman. 3. none of this will have any impact on your life. you just love to be mad i think.
i hope seika gets killed in the first cutscene if they ever  decide to bring her back in horizon 3  d
next horizon zero dawn prediction  alloy is replaced by two black lesbians who hate capitalism.
she s was cloned from a lesbian
destiny is the same way. they had to point out that ana is a lesbian. devrim kay  osirus  and sant 14 are gay.
bet anything modern tomb raider will go the same route
not buying hz 3  i don t have anything about female leads but this injection of ideology it s to far
ff16 confirmed by rumor to have gay characters for sony ps5 symbolic gay pride. we shall see if it is true.
she is bi.   haha
they made her ugly and a lesbian. i guess this is just what we do in all media. it s amazing that i have no interest in triple a titles these days. i can t quite put my finger on why.
the leaks already indicate such
at least nintendo does create strong hot female characters  not just peach  samus  and zelda  and does representation and characters of color right and in a tasteful way that never offends gamers fans.
i m done with sony. tlouii is what it is bad. gow  ragnar k was awful  and h  forbidden west was a bloated mess. i couldn t finish either one of them. i m glad i didn t buy the dlc for forbidden west.
you d think that lesbians would get tired of being depicted as ugly all the time.
i m pretty sure she was always gay  wasn t her original self elizabeth a gay woman
does being lesbian give you a pass for cultural appropriation with the dreads
i knew she d be homosexual since the first game lol i m not really surprised.
these day every western female lead who do some sucess they transform into a lesbian or trans
mirror
see most women don t poison or give away babies so we see that as default not a target mock whatever to cover child poison
good thing i never played that garbage
she looks the same as in the first game. and her being a lesbian so woke
lara croft and ally lesbian i m why do they keep giving the lgbtq woke agenda everything. lara and ally were fine such strong ladies before like why do they have to be with women!!!
aloy s gay by the way
two girls talk to each otherwoke writers  are they lesbians
they made aloy lesbian  ugh... lara croft too  this is going way too far.
why tomb raider  the character in writings  games and other. lara has always been heterosexual.
i don t have problems with lesbians  but in the 80 s and 90 s we had hot lesbians. there s a reason why mmo s with ultra hot anime girls are popular. only hot girl left is pauline in mario super golf. hahaha! until stellar blade anyway. the guys are handsome and no one complains.
that game is filled with strong female characters is position of power interest. the rest of secondary positions are for non-white males. and vilain baboon positions are for white males that get destroyed ridiculed by alloy. how could she be  in that sjw universe  be attracted to a male who is secondary  villain or a baboon    not gonna happen. she can only be matched with yet another strong character  position which is filled with females. sjw logic.
eh... yeah... zero christians like girl on girl. absolutely.
i dont mind a gay character  but please make it make sense. they just throw in gay scenes in everything now and it rarely has an effect on the story.
i m not buying horizon any more
have you even played the dlc  if not  wat are you even talking about!
same here. screw guerrilla games.
new aloy already look like a pasty lesbian anyway...
i lose hope in sony  nowadays i m only interested in japanese video games  that is why i don t buy ps5 because shit like this.
aloy liking woman women is not a new thing  and no shes not ugly.
i hate horizon  the femalecentric story made me feel unconfortable  all guys are worthless  villains or useless  and even their designs are weak!  if someone feels different is ok  but i lost all interest in the sequel after play the first!
i m glad i never played that stupid game.woke trash!
this gay woke thing must stop. don t put woke on triple a game or 1st party exclusive. because most normal people play top game.geez after this sony gonna make main male character gay..
all of this from the studio that made the killzone series. this is pathetic.
not going to buy that.
is she a lesbian in the main game  if she is just a lesbian in the dlc i can just pass on the dlc
compared to zero dawn  she kinda is
please don t make lara croft a lesbian... i don t hate lgbtq people but please don t change lara
that s why i don t buy ps5. i bought switch to avoid woke games.
republicans cry  again
i stopped playing that boring game from the first one.
so they made her obes and ugly
got bored of the first game and didn t even finish it  overrated ip.
let s make an rpg but then force them to role play as a queer
forbidden west was ok  but they put a lot of gays in there of course.
a male fantasy thing that s a very sexist thing to say
it seems like the majority of characters are gay in horizon. makes me wonder how civilization endures when half the population isn t even interested in reproducing.
so gross. i knew forbidden west was going to be a wokefest  so i skipped it.
lol!
aloy was honestly never good looking
gay for pay baby.
horizon forbidden west story was super boring and it drags on and the whole tilda and elizabet is pointless
i see a lot of comments on the dlc videos loving that she s now a lesbian. it s sick.
ugh  this is super annoying because forbidden west is an amazing game. like i got no real problem with gay characters  but not every character needs to be gay. i d rather they just never address it  at all. just hint at some stuff  maybe  but let her be the main character and leave it at that.
who cares if she s lesbian or not
why do we need to promote more gayness in anything anymore. it s getting old. really quick. as soon as i saw where the dlc was going. i ran through the missions to get it over with. just do i could play a different game.
it was implied early in forbidden west that she was gay
aloy was never attractive to begin with  playing through zero dawn  she was never attractive and had that stupid misandrist attitude throughout most of the game  i dont understand the confusion here
glad i never did find any interest in this woke game.
the first game was alright  although i didn t care for the climate change bullshit. when they first dropped those pictures of aloy looking like nikocado avocado i was out. i m happy that horizon got their shit kicked in by elden ring.
sry mel  chicks are the new dudes  here in 2023. now for the crazy part...if biden wins for president again. we will all know the system is fixed. lolololol
aloy was cloned from a lesbian  what s the issue here  anyone who played the game could ve told you that.
i m sick of all this  strong women  need to hate on men and be a big gay superhero. i can t watch anything or play anything with a female role cuz it s just a feminist lgbtq propaganda. i want a traditional female character who can partner up with a man and be stronger for it. only frat boys  feminists and incels fetishize about lesbians. now  the public is being fed that fetish and have to keep quite about it!
glad i didn t buy that game  i m sick of all this gay shit in everything  can t even watch a show about murderous drug dealers in college without a gay love scene randomly popping up.
same with gears 5 that girl looks like anita sarkisian with short lesbo hair.
honestly not surprised in the slightest  they made her less attractive in the sequel and this is modern western game so with a female lead so of course she s going to be a lesbian.
this is dumb  bat least you can choose to be like  uh nope
hzd was a good game but aloy was always fugly.
the story was meh  game is trash now they are going down the woke path to ruin it more  way to go.
what climate change bs in the first game
i got 100  on hzd and the plat trophy  i never saw anything indicating her mom was a lesbian. must have been so obscure i missed it
i guarantee that in the 3rd game  she will be a full blown lesbian  weather we want her to be or not.
seriously  wtf is y all problem with a little kiss ! you people weren t complaining about it in mass effect  so what s the problem now !! foh!!!!
boy  modern gaming sucks major balls. get it  balls
oh no the humanity is collapsed most 80  is dead what we gon do lets be gay and not have a kids
didn t you know that you can t be a strong  smart female hero unless you re a man hating lesbian !
look alloy gay everyone is attracted to the same sex! ! !
game is overrated anyway
i mean  this game is garbage  so what do you really expect
nope
people play this
what s with all the gays and lesbians in these apocalypse stories  don t they know that s a direct path to extinction
this is pathetic
yea horizon does have some woke aspects  but honestly i can make an acception for 2 hot girls kissing  but if it was 2 dudes  then i m out.
you loved horizon  zero dawn     what  w h y
ugly self-insert character by wokist.
horizon zero dawn was like days gone. a great game and story line. . . they just had to ruin it  didn t they
who cares about eloy  just dont want to see a lesbian lara croft
obviously  in a post apocalyptical future where humanity needs to recover we will be saved by the power of lesbianism. ugh.
horizon forbidden west and god of war sequels were not good in my opinion. all the feminist talking points and toxicity was there and kratos doesn t act like kratos this is a western developer problem making female characters unattractive and gay. japanese developers seem to be the only ones still making attractive.
wait  aloy is uglier  i thought she looked better in this game. as for being lesbian  i don t see the big deal. it s not like they ever established her orientation  anyway.
eww this happens with us gays too  they are always sexual feminine rapists. like there are gay men who are super masculine and not sexual molesters. beast from divinity original sin 2 and dorn il-khan from baldur s gate were the only good ones  they actually had a personality and an interesting story.
at least you re honest with your hypocrisy lol
so you thought freya was ugly in ragnarok
or angrboda
@dishonorable person  yes and they were all overly masculine
she looks fine in the game  just makes for gud click bait. i don t see the big deal either  so what that aloy hits it of with a cute asian  thats her business. besides it s an awesome dlc with a cool  interesting story  that looks amazing. people luv to bitch wat else is there to say.
who cares
none of you played burning shores
attracted to women despite being raised by a man she idolized and for good reason. right
i swear woke always ruins everything.
it s clearly woke propaganda  there are games where you have the choice of a romance according to your sexuality like the mass effect trilogy or cyberpunk 2077  and everyone is happy. and there are games that do lgbt propaganda like horizon or the last of us  which forces the player to see a lgbt romance for the purpose of propaganda. no need to get mad  or review bomb  just don t buy their games.
yeah that game looked like shit. 0 interest. i ll stick with nintendo
what is the point  don t buy the dlc and stop complaining.
calling a character ugly because they don t look like a super model. what a surprise. got to love christians that judge people on their looks constantly.
this game was a dumpster fire to begin with.crap game  crap characters. so clich  that it s tired.
do people actually like aloy  i thought she was the second worst part of horizon zero dawn  only topped by the laughably obnoxious sobek.
playstation should be called gaystation
yay more homosexuality! we love everything homosexual! more homosexuals for everyone!! wooo
fyi jesus was woke.
jews.
cool  another lesbian redhead  go to l.a turn gay  makes sense
at least she s not trans or non binary
this is why i don t buy sony.  nintendo is shit  but at least they keep it real.
in the 3rd game she will be a full blown lesbian. you won t have a choice if you want her to be or not.
i wish she would stop bringing up christians or any religious junk and beliefs.
believe me  it s coming.
